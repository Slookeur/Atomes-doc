<p>To get information on the connectivity of a material one can also rely on chain statistics.<br />
The idea of this calculation is to look for path between 2 atoms A and B, respecting the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Total coordination for A (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>) must be <span class="math inline">\(\ne\)</span> 2</p></li>
<li><p>Total coordination for B (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>) must be <span class="math inline">\(\ne\)</span> 2</p></li>
<li><p>Total coordination for all atom(s) between A and B must be equal to 2.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Chains are then litteraly succession of atoms isolated from the rest of the material.<br />
<span><em><span><strong>Atomes</strong></span></em></span>Â offers several options to enforce specific definition of a chain for the search:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Total coordination for A and B can be restricted to 1: searching for chains would mean searching for isolated 1 dimensional (on a coordination point of view) structures in the material.</p></li>
<li><p>The chemistry of the atoms in the chain(s) can be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Only searching for AAAA (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\alpha\alpha\alpha\)</span>) chains (homopolar bonds exclusively).</p></li>
<li><p>Excluding homopolar bonds from the search (heteropolar bonds exclusively).</p></li>
<li><p>Only searching for ABAB (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\beta\alpha\beta\)</span>) chains (perfect alternate of heteropolar bonds.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
