<p>Atoms in solids, liquids and gases move constantly at any given temperature, i.e. they are subject to a "thermal" displacement from their average positions. This displacement is particularly important in the case of a liquids. Atomic displacement does not follow a simple trajectory: "collisions" with other atoms render atomic trajectories quite complex shaped in space.<br />
The trajectory followed by an atom in a liquid resembles that of a pedestrian random walk. Mathematically this represents a sequence of steps done one after another where each step follows a random direction which does not depend on the one of the previous step (Markov’s chain of events).<br />
In the case of a one-dimensional system (straight line) the displacement of the atom will therefore be either a forward step (+) or a backward step (-). Furthermore it will be impossible to predict one or the other direction (forward or backward) since they have an equal probability to occur.<br />
One can conclude that the distance an atom may travel is close to zero. Nevertheless if we choose not to sum the displacements themselves (+/-) but the square of these displacements then we will end up with a non-zero, positive quantity of the total squared distance traveled. Consequently this allows to obtain a better evaluation of the real (square) distance traveled by an atom.<br />
The <span><strong>M</strong></span>ean <span><strong>S</strong></span>quare <span><strong>D</strong></span>isplacement MSD is defined by the relation: <span class="math display">\[\label{dyna1}
MSD(t)\ =\ \langle {\bf{r}}^{2}(t)\rangle\ =\ \left\langle |{\bf{r}}_{i}(t)-{\bf{r}}_{i}(0)|^{2}  \right\rangle\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\({\bf{r}}_{i}\)</span>(t) is the position of the atom <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> at the time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, and the <span class="math inline">\(\rangle\ \langle\)</span> represent an average on the time steps and/or the particles.<br />
However, during the analysis of the results of molecular dynamics simulations it is important to subtract the drift of the center of mass of the simulation box: <span class="math display">\[\label{dyna2}
MSD(t)\ =\ \left\langle \left|{\bf{r}}_{i}(t)-{\bf{r}}_{i}(0) - \left[{\bf{r}}_{cm}(t)-{\bf{r}}_{cm}(0)\right]\right|^{2}  \right\rangle\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\({\bf{r}}_{cm}\)</span>(t) represents the position of the center of mass of the system at the time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.<br />
The MSD also contains information on the diffusion of atoms. If the system is solid (frozen) then MSD "saturate", and the kinetic energy is not sufficient enough to reach a diffusive behavior. Nevertheless if the system is not frozen (e.g. liquid) then the MSD will grow linearly in time. In such a case it is possible to investigate the behavior of the system looking at the slope of the MSD. The slope of the MSD or the so called diffusion constant D is defined by: <span class="math display">\[\label{dyna3}
D\ =\ \lim_{t \to \infty}\ \frac{1}{6t}\ \langle {\bf{r}}^{2}(t) \rangle\]</span><br />
