<p>Invariants formed from bond spherical harmonics allow to obtain quantitative information on the local atomic symmetries in materials. The analysis starts by associating a set of spherical harmonics with every bond linking an atom to its nearest neighbors. For a given bond defined by a vector <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> a spherical harmonic may be defined as: <span class="math display">\[Q_{lm}(\vec{r})\  =\   Y_{lm} \langle \theta (\vec{r}), \psi (\vec{r}) \rangle\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(Y_{lm}(\theta, \psi)\)</span> is the spherical harmonic associated to the bond, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> are the angular components of the spherical coordinates of the bond which Cartesian coordinates are defined by <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span>.<br />
<br />
Because the <span class="math inline">\(Q_{lm}\)</span> for a given <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> can be scrambled by changing to a rotated coordinate system, it is important to consider rotational invariant combinations, such as {% cite PhysRevB.28.784 ChemSocFar.83-1335 %}: <span class="math display">\[Q_l\ =\ \left[\frac{4\pi}{2l+1} \sum_{m=-l}^{l} \left| \bar{Q}_{lm} \right|^2 \right]^{1/2}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\bar{Q}_{lm}\)</span> is defined by: <span class="math display">\[\bar{Q}_{lm}\ =\ \langle Q_{lm}( \vec{r} ) \rangle\]</span> and represents an average of the <span class="math inline">\(Y_{lm}(\theta, \psi)\)</span> over all <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> vectors in the system whether these vectors belong to the same atomic configuration or not. Just as the angular momentum quantum number, <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>, is a characteristic quantity of the ’shape’ of an atomic orbital, the quantity <span class="math inline">\(Q_l\)</span> is a rotationally invariant characteristic value of the shape/symmetry of a given local atomic configuration (if the average is not taken on all bonds of the system but only within a given configuration) or an average of such values for a set of configurations. Thus it is possible to compare <span class="math inline">\(Q_l\)</span>’s computed for well known crystal structures (e.g. FCC, HFC ...) and some local atomic configurations in a material’s model. The results of the comparison gives information for the presence/absence of a particular local atomic symmetry.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>atomes</strong></span> allows to compute the average <span class="math inline">\(Q_l\)</span>’s for each chemical species as well as the average <span class="math inline">\(Q_l\)</span>’s for a user specified local atomic coordination.</p>
