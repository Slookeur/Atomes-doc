<p>Several properties related to the atomic bonds and angles between them can be computed using <span><em><span><strong>Atomes</strong></span></em></span>. The existence or the absence of a bond between two atoms <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> of species <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> of species <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is determined by the analysis of the partial <span class="math inline">\(g_{\alpha\beta}(r)\)</span> and total <span class="math inline">\(g(r)\)</span> radial distribution functions. Precisely <span><em><span><strong>Atomes</strong></span></em></span> will consider that a bond exists if the interatomic distance <span class="math inline">\(D_{ij}\)</span> is smaller than both the cutoff given to describe the maximum distance for first neighbor atoms between the species <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Rcut_{\alpha\beta}\)</span> (often the first minimum of <span class="math inline">\(g_{\alpha\beta}(r)\)</span>), and the first minimum of the total radial distribution function, <span class="math inline">\(Rcut_{tot}\)</span>.<br />
<span><em><span><strong>Atomes</strong></span></em></span> allows the user to specify both <span class="math inline">\(Rcut_{\alpha\beta}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Rcut_{tot}\)</span> to choose an appropriate description of the atomic bonds in the system under study. When atomic bonds in a model are defined properly other structural characteristics can be evaluated, as follows:</p>
