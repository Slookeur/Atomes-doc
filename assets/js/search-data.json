The entire list of project(s) displayed in this part of the main window is a data structure called workspace, and atomes workspace files (*.awf files) can also be opened and saved, allowing to back up the entire list of projects at once, preserving the possible connections, data exchanges, between each projects. An illustration is presented in figure 1.1, many different projects being opened in the workspace. To each of these project is assigned an OpenGL 3D window, few of them being visible in figure 1.1. Double-clicking on the \"Workspace\" word at the top root of the tree, the list of all projects appears in the right side window.

    "title": "Crystal building in atomes",
    "content": "The crystal building process in atomes will be briefly presented in the next pages. 2 example cases will be used to illustrate the methodology implemented in the program: . | The Fd\\(\\bar{3}\\)m space group, N\\(^\\circ\\)227, with the first setting: origin 1. | The R\\(\\bar{3}\\)c space group, N\\(^\\circ\\)167, with the second setting: rhombohedral parameters. | . The terminology used in the atomes program, and therefore used in this manual, is directly taken from the International tables for Crystallography Vol. A. [1] In the following every single step depends on the considered space group, and corresponds to the way the process is implemented in atomes: . | Determine the origin of the coordinate system. | Calculate the inverse transformation matrix. | Select the space group extra site positions, if any. | Adjust the different symmetrical positions of the first Wyckoff position using [cb:2]. | Calculate the crystalline positions using [cb:4] and [cb:3]. | Select the unique position(s) in [cb:5] to build the crystal. | Calculate the object position in Cartesian coordinates using [cb:6]. | Insert object(s) at the appropriate coordinates based on occupancy. | . Origin of the coordinate system . The origin of the coordinate system, if any particular, determine how the object fractional coordinates are modified to match the space group criteria before calculating the Cartesian coordinates. The first step is to build the 4\\(\\times\\)3 matrix that describe the operation of be performed, the required information is given by the space group setting, the easiest way to use it is on the form of the transformation matrix P: Ex: (a, b, c) and can be converted in: \\[\\left[\\begin{array}{rrrr} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\quad 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\quad 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\quad 0 \\end{array}\\right]\\] . | (1) Fd\\(\\bar{3}\\)m space group, N\\(^\\circ\\)227, origin 1: | | (2) R\\(\\bar{3}\\)c space group, N\\(^\\circ\\)167, second setting: | . | | | . | (a-\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\), b-\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\), c-\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)) | | (\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)a+\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)b+\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)c, \\(-\\frac{1}{3}\\)a+\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)b+\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)c, \\(-\\frac{1}{3}\\)a-\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)b+\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)c) | . | The corresponding P matrix are: | | | . | \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{rrrr} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\quad -\\frac{1}{8} \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\quad -\\frac{1}{8} \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\quad -\\frac{1}{8} \\end{array}\\right]\\) | | \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{rrrr} \\frac{2}{3} &amp; -\\frac{1}{3} &amp; -\\frac{1}{3} &amp; \\quad 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{3} &amp; \\frac{1}{3} &amp; -\\frac{2}{3} &amp; \\quad 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{3} &amp; \\frac{1}{3} &amp; \\frac{1}{3} &amp; \\quad 0 \\end{array}\\right]\\) | . Inverse transformation matrix . To transform the coordinates to the appropriate system we use the corresponding inverse matrix P\\(^{-1}\\): . | (1) Fd\\(\\bar{3}\\)m space group, N\\(^\\circ\\)227, origin 1: | | (2) R\\(\\bar{3}\\)c space group, N\\(^\\circ\\)167, second setting: | . | \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{rrrr} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\quad -\\frac{1}{8} \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\quad -\\frac{1}{8} \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\quad -\\frac{1}{8} \\end{array}\\right]\\) | | \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{rrrr} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\quad 0 \\\\ -1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; \\quad 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 &amp; \\quad 0 \\end{array}\\right]\\) | . The P\\(^{-1}\\) matrix allows to easily compute the coordinates \\((x&#39;,y&#39;,z&#39;)\\) of a point \\((x,y,z)\\) in the appropriate coordinate system using: \\[\\label{sgconv} (x&#39;,y&#39;,z&#39;) = {\\bf{P}}^{-1} \\times (x,y,z)\\] . Space group extra site position(s) . The space group extra site position(s) describe translations to be performed on the initial set of Wyckoff position to get the entire list of coordinates. The list of extra position(s), \\(E(e_x,e_y,e_z)\\), is imported from the space group data file, and is presented on top the Wyckoff positions table of the space group info window: . | (1) Fd\\(\\bar{3}\\)m space group, N\\(^\\circ\\)227, origin 1: | | (2) R\\(\\bar{3}\\)c space group, N\\(^\\circ\\)167, second setting: | . | \\(+ (0,0,0) + (0,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2},0,\\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},0)\\) | | \\(+ (0,0,0) + (0,0,0) + (0,0,0)\\) | . Symmetrical positions using the first Wyckoff position . The first step is to convert the list of coordinates from the first Wyckoff position on the form of matrix W: . | (1) Fd\\(\\bar{3}\\)m space group, N\\(^\\circ\\)227, origin 1: | | (2) R\\(\\bar{3}\\)c space group, N\\(^\\circ\\)167, second setting: | . | (x, y, z) | | (x, y, z) | . | \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{rrrr} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right]\\) | | \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{rrrr} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\end{array}\\right]\\) | . The W’ matrix, suitable for the calculation, is calculated using the P\\(^{-1}\\) matrix for the corresponding space group: \\[{\\bf{W&#39;}} = {\\bf{W}} \\times {\\bf{P^{-1}}}\\] . | (1) Fd\\(\\bar{3}\\)m space group, N\\(^\\circ\\)227, origin 1: | | (2) R\\(\\bar{3}\\)c space group, N\\(^\\circ\\)167, second setting: | . | \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{rrrr} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\quad -\\frac{1}{8} \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\quad -\\frac{1}{8} \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\quad -\\frac{1}{8} \\end{array}\\right]\\) | | \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{rrrr} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\quad 0 \\\\ -1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; \\quad 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 &amp; \\quad 0 \\end{array}\\right]\\) | . The results, converted back to standard coordinates, are presented in the Wyckoff positions table of the space group info window: . | (1) Fd\\(\\bar{3}\\)m space group, N\\(^\\circ\\)227, origin 1: | | (2) R\\(\\bar{3}\\)c space group, N\\(^\\circ\\)167, second setting: | . | \\((x - \\frac{1}{8}, y - \\frac{1}{8}, z - \\frac{1}{8})\\) | | \\((x + z, - x + y + z, - y + z)\\) | . | \\(\\dots\\) | | \\(\\dots\\) | . Object position(s) . The first step in getting the final fractional coordinates \\(F(f_x, f_y, f_z)\\) of an object to insert with fractional coordinates given at input \\(O(o_x, o_y, o_z)\\) is to convert its coordinates to the proper coordinates system \\(O&#39;(o_x&#39;, o_y&#39;, o_z&#39;)\\): \\[O&#39;(o_x&#39;, o_y&#39;, o_z&#39;) = {\\bf{P}} \\times O(o_x, o_y, o_z)\\] Then for a particular Wyckoff position W’ and extra site position \\(E(x,y,z)\\), the final fractional coordinates \\(F(f_x, f_y, f_z)\\) are calculated by: \\[F(f_x, f_y, f_z) = E(e_x,e_y,e_z) + {\\bf{W&#39;}} \\times O&#39;(o_x&#39;, o_y&#39;, o_z&#39;)\\] . Removing duplicate position(s) . Since one of the goal in atomes is to build crystal structure of super-structure to work with, all crystalline positions cannot be conserved and duplicate positions (same positions using the periodic boundary conditions) must be removed. When final positions \\(F(f_x, f_y, f_z)\\) are calculated duplicates are removed on the fly. The first final position with a unique set of coordinates \\(F(f_x, f_y, f_z)\\) is preserved while the others will be ignored. Duplicates are identical set of atomic coordinates, that can be found because of the symmetrical properties of the space group. In atomes a duplicate position \\(F_b(b_x, b_y, b_z)\\) will be removed if \\(F_a(a_x, a_y, a_z)\\) has already been found and providing that: . | | \\(\\begin{bmatrix} a_x &amp; = &amp; b_x &amp; \\bf{or} &amp; abs(a_x - b_x) &amp; = &amp; n, n \\text{ integer} \\end{bmatrix}\\) | . | and | \\(\\begin{bmatrix} a_y &amp; = &amp; b_y &amp; \\bf{or} &amp; abs(a_y - b_y) &amp; = &amp; n, n \\text{ integer} \\end{bmatrix}\\) | . | and | \\(\\begin{bmatrix}a_z &amp; = &amp; b_z &amp; \\bf{or} &amp; abs(a_z - b_z) &amp; = &amp; n, n \\text{ integer} \\end{bmatrix}\\) | . Calculate the object final position(s) in Cartesian coordinates . After the construction/selection process Cartesian coordinates \\(C(c_x, c_y, c_z)\\) of an object with fractional coordinates \\(F(f_x, f_y, f_z)\\) are calculated using: \\[C(c_x, c_y, c_z) = {\\bf{FtC}} \\times F(f_x, f_y, f_z)\\] with FtC the fractional to Cartesian conversion matrix is defined by: \\[\\begin{bmatrix} \\bf{a} &amp; \\bf{b}\\cos{\\gamma} &amp; \\bf{c}\\cos{\\beta} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\bf{b}\\sin{\\gamma} &amp; \\bf{c}\\omega \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\frac{\\Omega}{\\bf{ab}\\sin{\\gamma}} \\end{bmatrix}\\] where \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\Omega\\) are respectively: \\[\\omega = \\frac{\\cos{\\alpha} - \\cos{\\beta}\\cos{\\gamma}}{\\sin{\\gamma}}\\] and: \\[\\Omega = \\bf{abc}\\sqrt{1-\\cos^2{\\alpha} -\\cos^2{\\beta} -\\cos^2{\\gamma} + 2\\cos{\\alpha}\\cos{\\beta}\\cos{\\gamma}}\\] a, b, c and \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\gamma\\) are the lattice parameters provided at input. Occupancy . The only thing left to do after that it to select which set of coordinates are to be occupied among the list prepared in the previous steps. Depending on the occupancy defined at input atomes does the following: . | If the occupancy is equal to 1.0: all coordinates are to be occupied and no particular selection is performed. | If the occupancy is &lt; 1.0, then the following options are possible to handle occupancy: . | \"Random for the initial cell only\": sites are filled randomly in the initial cell only, then the initial cell is simply replicated. | \"Random cell by cell\": sites are filled randomly for each cell, cell by cell separately. | \"Completely random\": sites are filled randomly for the entire network, the final crystal is considered as whole. | \"Successively\": sites are filled successively, all object(s) A are inserted (for the first \\(n(A)\\) positions), then all object(s) B are inserted (for the next \\(n(B)\\) positions) ... | \"Alternatively\": sites are filled alternatively: object A is inserted on the first position, object B is inserted on the second position, object A on the third position, object B on the fourth position ... and so on. | .

    "content": "Taking into account the finite size of model/simulation box is crucial to compute correctly many of the structural characteristics (e.g. ring statistics) of the system being studied. The importance of the finite size of model box can be illustrated using a 1 \\(dm^3\\) edged cube of water (1 L) at room temperature. This cube contains approximately \\(3.3 \\times 10^{25}\\) water molecules, each of them can be considered as a sphere having a diameter of 2.8 Å. Following this scheme surface interactions can affect up to 10 layers of spheres (water molecules) far from the surface of the model cubic box. In this case the number of water molecules exposed to the surface is about \\(2 \\times 10^{19}\\), which is a small fraction of the total number of molecules in the model. Currently structure models often contain somewhere from 1 thousand to several thousands of molecules/atoms. As a result a very substantial fraction of them will be influenced by the finite size of the simulation/model box. The problems is solved by applying the so-called Periodic Boundary Conditions \"PBC\" which means surrounding the simulation box with its translational images in the 3 directions of space, as illustrated below. Users of atomes should take special care that their model boxes are inherently periodic so that when the periodic boundary conditions are applied the structural characteristics computed are not compromised. Figure 5.1: Schematic representation of the idea of periodic boundary conditions. Figure 5.1 illustrates the principle of the periodic boundary conditions that can be used1 in atomes: a particle which goes out from the simulation box by one side is reintroduced in the box by the opposite side (in the 3 dimensions of space). When PBC are used the maximum inter-atomic distance r\\(_{max}\\) which is taken into account in the calculations, depends on the lattice parameters: \\[r_{max} \\simeq \\frac{L\\times\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\qquad \\text{with}\\ L = \\text{box size}\\] The surface/finite model size effects would therefore be small, if any. In general, the larger the simulation box and the number of molecules/atoms in it, the smaller the surface/size effects will be. | Please note that the use of PBC is not mandatory, isolated molecules can be studied using atomes↩︎ . | .

In such a network a series of nodes and links connected sequentially without overlap is called a path. Following this definition a ring is therefore simply a closed path.

    "content": "Invariants formed from bond spherical harmonics allow to obtain quantitative information on the local atomic symmetries in materials. The analysis starts by associating a set of spherical harmonics with every bond linking an atom to its nearest neighbors. For a given bond defined by a vector \\(\\vec{r}\\) a spherical harmonic may be defined as: \\[Q_{lm}(\\vec{r})\\ =\\ Y_{lm} \\langle \\theta (\\vec{r}), \\psi (\\vec{r}) \\rangle\\] where \\(Y_{lm}(\\theta, \\psi)\\) is the spherical harmonic associated to the bond, \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are the angular components of the spherical coordinates of the bond which Cartesian coordinates are defined by \\(\\vec{r}\\). Because the \\(Q_{lm}\\) for a given \\(l\\) can be scrambled by changing to a rotated coordinate system, it is important to consider rotational invariant combinations, such as [1], [2]: \\[Q_l\\ =\\ \\left[\\frac{4\\pi}{2l+1} \\sum_{m=-l}^{l} \\left| \\bar{Q}_{lm} \\right|^2 \\right]^{1/2}\\] where \\(\\bar{Q}_{lm}\\) is defined by: \\[\\bar{Q}_{lm}\\ =\\ \\langle Q_{lm}( \\vec{r} ) \\rangle\\] and represents an average of the \\(Y_{lm}(\\theta, \\psi)\\) over all \\(\\vec{r}\\) vectors in the system whether these vectors belong to the same atomic configuration or not. Just as the angular momentum quantum number, \\(l\\), is a characteristic quantity of the ’shape’ of an atomic orbital, the quantity \\(Q_l\\) is a rotationally invariant characteristic value of the shape/symmetry of a given local atomic configuration (if the average is not taken on all bonds of the system but only within a given configuration) or an average of such values for a set of configurations. Thus it is possible to compare \\(Q_l\\)’s computed for well known crystal structures (e.g. FCC, HFC ...) and some local atomic configurations in a material’s model. The results of the comparison gives information for the presence/absence of a particular local atomic symmetry. atomes allows to compute the average \\(Q_l\\)’s for each chemical species as well as the average \\(Q_l\\)’s for a user specified local atomic coordination. | P.

    "title": "Mean square displacement of atoms",
    "content": "Atoms in solids, liquids and gases move constantly at any given temperature, i.e. they are subject to a \"thermal\" displacement from their average positions. This displacement is particularly important in the case of a liquids. Atomic displacement does not follow a simple trajectory: \"collisions\" with other atoms render atomic trajectories quite complex shaped in space. The trajectory followed by an atom in a liquid resembles that of a pedestrian random walk. Mathematically this represents a sequence of steps done one after another where each step follows a random direction which does not depend on the one of the previous step (Markov’s chain of events). In the case of a one-dimensional system (straight line) the displacement of the atom will therefore be either a forward step (+) or a backward step (-). Furthermore it will be impossible to predict one or the other direction (forward or backward) since they have an equal probability to occur. One can conclude that the distance an atom may travel is close to zero. Nevertheless if we choose not to sum the displacements themselves (+/-) but the square of these displacements then we will end up with a non-zero, positive quantity of the total squared distance traveled. Consequently this allows to obtain a better evaluation of the real (square) distance traveled by an atom. The Mean Square Displacement MSD is defined by the relation: \\[\\label{dyna1} MSD(t)\\ =\\ \\langle {\\bf{r}}^{2}(t)\\rangle\\ =\\ \\left\\langle |{\\bf{r}}_{i}(t)-{\\bf{r}}_{i}(0)|^{2} \\right\\rangle\\] where \\({\\bf{r}}_{i}\\)(t) is the position of the atom \\(i\\) at the time \\(t\\), and the \\(\\rangle\\ \\langle\\) represent an average on the time steps and/or the particles. However, during the analysis of the results of molecular dynamics simulations it is important to subtract the drift of the center of mass of the simulation box: \\[\\label{dyna2} MSD(t)\\ =\\ \\left\\langle \\left|{\\bf{r}}_{i}(t)-{\\bf{r}}_{i}(0) - \\left[{\\bf{r}}_{cm}(t)-{\\bf{r}}_{cm}(0)\\right]\\right|^{2} \\right\\rangle\\] where \\({\\bf{r}}_{cm}\\)(t) represents the position of the center of mass of the system at the time \\(t\\). The MSD also contains information on the diffusion of atoms. If the system is solid (frozen) then MSD \"saturate\", and the kinetic energy is not sufficient enough to reach a diffusive behavior. Nevertheless if the system is not frozen (e.g. liquid) then the MSD will grow linearly in time. In such a case it is possible to investigate the behavior of the system looking at the slope of the MSD. The slope of the MSD or the so called diffusion constant D is defined by: \\[\\label{dyna3} D\\ =\\ \\lim_{t \\to \\infty}\\ \\frac{1}{6t}\\ \\langle {\\bf{r}}^{2}(t) \\rangle\\] atomes provides access to the several MSD related functions: . | MSD for each chemical species with autocorrelation on all the dynamics . | MSD for each chemical species without autocorrelation on all the dynamics (step by step) . | Directional MSD (x, y, z, xy, xz, yz) for each chemical species with autocorrelation on all the dynamics . | Directional MSD (x, y, z, xy, xz, yz) for each chemical species without autocorrelation on all the dynamics (step by step) . | Drift of the center of mass (x, y, z) . | Correction applied to correct the drift of the center of mass in equation [Eq.

It regroups a comprehensive panel of specialized edition tools, several assistants dedicated to the preparation of numerical experiments, and, a large number of physico-chemical analysis. Advanced visualization utilities and capabilities being available at each stage of the process atomes introduces innovative 3D rendering possibilities and intuitive applications of the calculation results. atomes is designed to analyze, to visualize and to create/edit large three-dimensional atomic scale models, and can handle MD trajectories from hundreds of thousands, up to millions, of atoms. Using OpenMP parallelization, file processing, coordination and physico-chemical analysis make use of the advantages of modern CPUs and their multiple cores. Consequently when importing atomic coordinates several properties are analyzed on the fly regardless of the size, in number of atoms or MD steps, and the periodicity of the system. atomes offers a workspace that allows to have many projects opened simultaneously. The different projects in the workspace can exchange data: analysis results, atomic coordinates ... atomes also provides an advanced input preparation system for further calculations using well known molecular dynamics codes: . | Classical MD : DL-POLY [1] and LAMMPS [2] . | ab-initio MD : CPMD [3] and CP2K [4] . | QM-MM MD : CPMD [3] and CP2K [4] . | . To prepare the input files for these calculations is likely to be the key, and most complicated step towards MD simulations. atomes offers a user-friendly assistant to help and guide the user step by step to achieve this crucial step.

This dialog allows to tweak the chemical and physical properties of the elements found in the coordinates file (see figure 3.4).

Figure 6.3: The \"Crystal builder\" window in the atomes program. The \"Crystal builder\" window [Fig. 6.3] allows the creation of crystalline structure(s) and super-structure(s). Thus not only atom(s) but also molecules can be inserted to the crystalline positions defined by the space group. The \"Select ...\" menu allows to insert objects: atoms, molecules, and atom selections from any other project opened in the atomes workspace. It will be presented in details in section 6.1.2.10, at the exception of the \"Empty site\" button unique to the \"Crystal builder\" and that will be introduced in the next pages related to the occupancy. Each object will be inserted at a position specified using the fractional coordinates, in the proportion of the occupancy, and following the rules of the selected space group.

In any case the number \\(n(A)\\) of object(s) A to be inserted in calculated using: \\[n(A) = NP \\times occ(A) \\nonumber\\] \\(NP\\) is the number of position(s) to fill, \\(occ(A)\\) is the occupancy for object A. Overlapping, object(s) on the same position, can also be allowed, the concept will be illustrated in the following examples. | . | . Using the crystal builder: space group information . Once a space group has been selected it is possible to access the \"Space group info\" dialog using the \"group info\" button: . Figure 6.4: The \"space group info\" dialog for the R\\(\\bar{3}\\)c group in the atomes program. The main information available is presented in the \"space group info\" dialog [Fig. 6.4], including the different setting(s), and the corresponding initial coordinates and Wyckoff positions. Using the crystal builder: building crystal(s) . The following pages will present crystal building examples using the Fd\\(\\bar{3}\\)m (origin 1 setting) space group (diamond-like structure): . | The C-diamond structure: . Figure 6.5: Building a C-diamond crystal in the atomes program. The following steps are required to build the C-diamond crystalline structure (see figure 6.5-left): . | Select the Fd\\(\\bar{3}\\)m space group (\"Cubic -&gt; Face-centered -&gt; 227: Fd-3m\") . | Set the value for the lattice parameter: \\(\\simeq\\) 3.5 Å . | Insert a C atom at (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) with occupancy to 1.0, you can edit both coordinates and occupancy by double-clicking on the corresponding line. | Select the \"Insert check button\" to use the atom to build the crystal, or alternatively click to top of the \"Insert\" column to insert all elements. | Finally simply click on the \"Build / Build (new project)\" button. | . The crystal is then displayed (see figure 6.5-right), also clones (atoms linked using the PBC see section 5.1.2.3) are immediately shown. The existence of a chemical bond depending on the cutoff(s), determined automatically when creating the crystal, you might need to adjust the values to define properly the bonding of the system. | The C-diamond structure, playing with occupancy: In these examples the parameters to build the crystal remain exactly similar to [cd1], only the total number of cells will be increased to 2 on a: . | Occupancy = 1.0: . With 8 atoms per cell, the total number of atoms in the system is equal to 16. | Occupancy = 0.5: . With an occupancy of 0.5 the number of atoms per cell will be reduced to 4, and the total number of atoms in the system to 8. | (1) | | \\(\\Longrightarrow\\) | | . \"Random for the initial cell only\": The same treatment is applied to each cell, inducing an overall symmetry. The system is not disordered with 4 atoms per cell at the exact same positions. | (2) | | \\(\\Longrightarrow\\) | | . \"Random cell by cell\": A random treatment is applied to each cell independently. The system is disordered, but the number of atoms per cell remains equal to 4. | (3) | | \\(\\Longrightarrow\\) | | . \"Completely random\": The system is entirely disordered. The average value 0.5 C atoms per site is respected for the entire structure, but the number of atom(s) per cell can change. This option if particularly useful when the occupancy for a particular site is very low, see the section remarks afterwards for more information. To illustrate (4) \"Successively\" and (5) \"Alternatively\" it is interesting to use more than one chemical species: . | Adding O atoms: | | Adding O and N atoms: | . | For all chemical species: | | For all chemical species: | . | - The occupancy is equal to 0.5 | | - The occupancy is equal 0.333 | . | - The site is the same (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) | | - The site is the same (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) | . | \\(\\Downarrow\\) | | \\(\\Downarrow\\) | . | | | . | \\(\\Downarrow\\) | | \\(\\Downarrow\\) | . | | | . | | | . | | | . | | | . | | | . In both cases (4) \"Successively\" and (5) \"Alternatively\": The system is ordered. The average values of the occupancy per site are respected for the entire structure. | The C-diamond structure, playing with molecules: As already mentioned atomes does not only allow to build atomic crystalline structures but also molecular crystalline super-structures. Figure 6.6: Building a C-diamond like C\\(_{60}\\) crystalline super-structure. The \"Insert...\" menu allows indeed to insert fragments from the library or from any project opened in the workspace. Using C\\(_{60}\\) fullerene molecules instead of carbon atoms (and increasing the lattice parameter appropriately) allows to obtain the structure illustrated in figure 6.6. As for the atom(s) tweaking the occupancy can be useful with molecules: . Using the (4) \"Successively\" occupancy set-up, you build: . Figure 6.7: Building a C-diamond like, alternating C\\(_{60}\\) and toluene molecules, crystalline super-structure. | The C-diamond structure, molecules and overlapping: As mentioned using the \"Allow overlapping\" option allows to insert at the same crystalline positions. The interest is limited to molecules-molecules overlapping or molecules-atoms overlapping, there is no point in getting two atoms at the same position. The idea behind this concept is to allows the encapsulation of an object by another one: . Figure 6.8: Building a C-diamond like, toluene encapsulated C\\(_{240}\\), crystalline super-structure. The \"Molecules\" color-map (see sec. 5.1.1.2) for atoms and bonds is used for clarity purposes. | . | . | Crystal building: for more on the crystal building process see appendix 4. Here are some important things happening when building a crystal in atomes: . | At the beginning of the process the size of the object(s) to insert is compared to the lattice parameters, if the lattice parameters are considered too small a warning message will pop-up: . | For an atom, the size is set to 1.0 Å. | For a molecule, the size is the maximum interatomic distance within the molecule. | . The process is not fail-safe, and without being careful it is possible to build a crystal with an improper bonding. The distance matrix calculation to determine bonding information is performed on the fly at the end of the building process, if the crystal bonding is too bad, this calculation could fail and no bond will be display. If the crystalline structure is good, then simply correct the bond cutoff to perform the calculation again, and get the correct bonding information. | At the end of the process all the atoms are wrapped back in the unit cell. | The bond cutoff are determined automatically, therefore the visual aspect of the final structure might be misleading, with too much of too few bonds compared to what was expected. | When inserting a molecule remember that there is not way to determine its orientation, with water molecules for instance it might be required to rotate the molecule(s) afterwards, see section 6.1.3 for more information. | . | Occupancy: as illustrated previously the order the object(s) is(are) inserted on the crystalline positions might have an importance on the final structure. This is true when the occupancy is &lt; 1.0 and / or when object can share the same site when using the \"Allow overlapping\" option. To ensure that the desired crystal will be built, either insert the object in the proper order or re-order them using the mouse drag an drop: . The occupancy \\(occ({\\bf{\\textit{s}}})\\) for a site s \\((x_s, y_s, z_s)\\) is defined as: \\[occ({\\bf{\\textit{s}}}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} occ(i)\\] for the \\(N\\) object(s) on the same site \\((x_s, y_s, z_s)\\) . | Empty position: the \"Empty position\" button of the \"Select ...\" menu is used to force the insertion of empty position(s). The empty site(s) are always treated before any object insertion(s), even if the position in the insertion tree is not on top. In the case of \"Overlapping\"+\"Empty position\" the rules for occupancy are modified as follow: \\[occ({\\bf{\\textit{s}}}) = \\max_{i=1}^{N} occ(i) + \\sum_{j=1}^{E} occ(j) \\\\[0.25cm]\\] for the \\(N\\) object(s) and \\(E\\) empty positions on the same site \\((x_s, y_s, z_s)\\). | . | “Space-group symmetry,” International Tables for Crystallography, vol.

    "content": "Neutron or X-ray scattering static structure factor \\(S(q)\\) is defined as: \\[\\label{s2q_1} S(q)=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j,k} b_j\\,b_k \\left&lt; e^{\\displaystyle{iq[{\\bf{r}}_j-{\\bf{r}}_k]}} \\right&gt;\\] where \\(b_j\\) and \\({\\bf{r}}_j\\) represent respectively the neutron or X-ray scattering length, and the position of the atom \\(j\\). \\(N\\) is the total number of atoms in the system studied. To take into account the inherent/volume averaging of scattering experiments it is necessary to sum all possible orientations of the wave vector \\(q\\) compared to the vector \\({\\bf{r}}_j-{\\bf{r}}_k\\). This average on the orientations of the \\(q\\) vector leads to the famous Debye’s equation: \\[\\label{s2q_2} S(q)\\ =\\ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j,k} b_j\\,b_k \\frac{\\sin (q|{\\bf{r}}_j-{\\bf{r}}_k|)}{q|{\\bf{r}}_j-{\\bf{r}}_k|}\\] Nevertheless the instantaneous individual atomic contributions introduced by this equation [s2q_2] are not easy to interpret. It is more interesting to express these contributions using the formalism of radial distribution functions [Sec. 5.2]. In order to achieve this goal it is first necessary to split the self-atomic contribution (\\(j=k\\)), from the contribution between distinct atoms: \\[\\label{s2q_3} S(q)\\ =\\ \\sum_{j}\\ c_j b_j^2\\ +\\ \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j\\ne k} b_j\\,b_k \\frac{\\sin (q|{\\bf{r}}_j-{\\bf{r}}_k|)}{q|{\\bf{r}}_j-{\\bf{r}}_k|}}_{\\displaystyle{I(q)}} \\qquad \\text{with}\\quad c_j=\\frac{N_j}{N}\\] where \\(4\\pi\\ \\sum_{j}\\ c_j b_j^2\\) represents the total scattering cross section of the material. The function \\(I(q)\\) which describes the interaction between distinct atoms is related to the radial distribution functions through a Fourier transformation: \\[\\label{s2q_4} I(q)\\ =\\ 4 \\pi \\rho\\ \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\ dr\\ r^{2}\\ \\frac{\\sin qr}{qr}\\ G(r)\\] where the function \\(G(r)\\) is defined using the partial radial distribution functions [Eq. [g2r_4]]: \\[\\label{s2q_5} G(r)\\ =\\ \\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\ c_{\\alpha} b_{\\alpha}\\ c_{\\beta} b_{\\beta}\\ (g_{\\alpha\\beta}(r) -1)\\] where \\(c_{\\alpha}=\\displaystyle{\\frac{N_\\alpha}{N}}\\) and \\(b_{\\alpha}\\) represents the neutron or X-ray scattering length of species \\(\\alpha\\). \\(G(r)\\) approaches - \\(\\displaystyle{-\\ \\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta}}\\ c_{\\alpha} b_{\\alpha}\\ c_{\\beta} b_{\\beta}\\) for \\(r = 0\\), and 0 for \\(r\\to\\infty\\). Usually the self-contributions are subtracted from equation [s2q_3] and the structure factor is normalized using the relation: \\[\\label{s2q_6} S(q)\\ -\\ 1\\ =\\ \\frac{I(q)}{\\displaystyle{\\langle b^{2} \\rangle}} \\quad \\text{with} \\quad \\langle b^{2} \\rangle = \\left(\\sum_{\\alpha} c_{\\alpha} b_{\\alpha} \\right)^{2}\\] It is therefore possible to write the structure factor [Eq. [s2q_2]] in a more standard way: \\[\\label{s2q_7} S(q)\\ =\\ 1\\ +\\ 4 \\pi \\rho \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\ dr\\ r^{2}\\ \\frac{\\sin qr}{qr} ({\\bf{g}}(r) -1)\\] where \\({\\bf{g}}(r)\\) (the radial distribution function) is defined as: \\[\\label{s2q_8} {\\bf{g}}(r)\\ =\\ \\frac{\\displaystyle{\\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta}}\\ c_{\\alpha} b_{\\alpha}\\ c_{\\beta} b_{\\beta}\\ g_{\\alpha\\beta}(r) }{\\displaystyle{\\langle b^{2} \\rangle}}\\] In the case of a single atomic species system the normalization allows to obtain values of \\(S(q)\\) and \\({\\bf{g}}(r)\\) which are independent of the scattering factor/length and therefore independent of the measurement technique. In most cases, however, the total \\(S(q)\\) and \\({\\bf{g}}(r)\\) are combinations of the partial functions weighted using the scattering factor and therefore depend on the measurement technique (Neutron, X-rays ...) used or simulated. Figure 5.4: Total neutron structure factor for glassy GeS\\(_2\\) at 300 K - A Evaluation using the atomic correlations [Eq. [s2q_2]], B Evaluation using the pair correlation functions [Eq. [s2q_7]]. Figure 5.4 presents a comparison between the calculations of the total neutron structure factor done using the Debye relation [Eq. [s2q_2]] and the pair correlation functions [Eq. [s2q_7]]. The material studied is a sample of glassy GeS\\(_2\\) at 300 K obtained using ab-initio molecular dynamics. In several cases the structure factor \\(S(q)\\) and the radial distribution function \\({\\bf{g}}(r)\\) [Eq. [s2q_8]] can be compared to experimental data. To simplify the comparison atomes computes several radial distribution functions used in practice such as \\(G(r)\\) defined [Eq. [s2q_5]], the differential correlation function \\(D(r)\\), \\({\\bf{G}}(r)\\), and the total correlation function \\(T(r)\\) defined by: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\label{s2q_9} D(r)\\ =\\ 4\\pi r \\rho\\ G(r) \\\\ \\nonumber {\\bf{G}}(r)\\ =\\ \\frac{D(r)}{\\langle b^{2} \\rangle} \\\\ T(r)\\ =\\ D(r)\\ +\\ 4\\pi r \\rho\\ \\langle b^{2} \\rangle \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\] \\({\\bf{g}}(r)\\) equals zero for \\(r=0\\) and approaches 1 for \\(r\\to\\infty\\). \\(D(r)\\) equals zero for \\(r=0\\) and approaches 0 for \\(r\\to\\infty\\). \\({\\bf{G}}(r)\\) equals zero for \\(r=0\\) and approaches 0 for \\(r\\to\\infty\\). \\(T(r)\\) equals zero for \\(r=0\\) and approaches \\(\\infty\\) for \\(r\\to\\infty\\). This set of functions for a model of GeS\\(_2\\) glass (at 300 K) obtained using ab-initio molecular dynamics is presented in figure 5.5.

Before going further it is strongly advised to read the DL-POLY user manual: ftp://ftp.dl.ac.uk/ccp5/DL_POLY/DL_POLY_4.0/DOCUMENTS/USRMAN4.pdf . Initializing the force field . Figure 7.1: Initializing the force field in the DL-POLY calculation assistant. The mandatory first step in the DL-POLY calculation assistant is to initialize the force field, as illustrated in figure 7.1 it required to select both: . | The force field to be used, ie. the data source for many of the \"FIELD\" file parameters including: bonds, angles, dihedrals and inversions. The FIELD file parameters can be imported from the following force fields: . | OPLS force fields: . | OPLS All-atoms for proteins . | OPLS All-atoms for RNA . | . | CHARMM force fields: . | CHARMM 22 proteins . | CHARMM 22 proteins and metals . | CHARMM 35 ethers . | CHARMM 36 carbenes . | CHARMM 36 general . | CHARMM 36 lipids . | CHARMM 36 Nucleid acids . | CHARMM 36 proteins . | CHARMM 36 proteins and metals . | CHARMM silicates . | . | . | AMBER force fields: . | AMBER 94 . | AMBER 96 . | AMBER 98 . | AMBER 99 . | . | Consistent force fields: . | CVFF . | CVFF Augmented . | CFF 91 . | PCFF . | COMPASS . | . | . Theses parameters are read by atomes on the fly / by request from the corresponding files located in the directory: \"bin/library/force_fields\". | The atoms description to initiate the force field, ie. the first \"rough\" type of field atoms for the initial description of the force field: . | The atomic species . | The atomic species and the total coordination(s) . | The atomic species and the partial coordination(s) . | . | . Once the force field has been initialized the default pages populates the assistant: . Figure 7.2: The initialized force field in the DL-POLY calculation assistant. The \"CONTROL\" file . When the force field has been initialized and providing the \"CONTROL\" file is to be prepared, it is possible to adjust the corresponding options. These options are regrouped in 8 tabs illustrated in figure 7.3, and almost all options from the DL-POLY user guide are available, with the exception of the Plumed calculation options and some options for the two-temperature \"ttm\" model. Figure 7.3: The \"CONTROL\" file options in the DL-POLY calculation assistant. The \"FIELD\" file . If the \"FIELD\" file is to be prepared then the corresponding tabs are also made available in the assistant. Force field elements . The first tab related to the \"FIELD\" file allows to enable or disable all kind of component(s) for the force field to be created: . Figure 7.4: \"Select the component(s) of the force field\" tab in the DL-POLY calculation assistant. The \"Energy unit\" combo box, allows to change the energy units for the field parameters, please note that changing the energy unit will convert all parameters in the \"FIELD\" file to the new unit. The other options are divided in 2 categories, the \"Intra-molecular interaction(s)\" options and the \"Non-bonded interaction(s)\" options. To enable / disable any feature simply check / uncheck the corresponding button in this tab, then the associated page will be inserted / removed from the list of pages available in the assistant. General behavior of the \"FIELD\" file part of the assistant . Each page of the assistant is dedicated to a particular property, the first pages (up to 13 pages) being dedicated to intra-molecular interactions and the latest pages (up to 6 pages) being dedicated to non-bonded interactions. Each page contains a table presenting the list of the associated properties, double clicking on a line with the mouse left button will allow to edit the corresponding line/property, while the mouse right button will open a contextual menu with different set of actions including the edition available otherwise. For almost each and every intra or inter-molecular property listed in the corresponding tab, corresponds a \"Use\" check button. It is mandatory to check-in the \"Use\" button for the property to be used when building the \"FIELD\" (remember that few are mutually exclusive), if not then the information is simply stored for further usage. Any objects selection is associated with a visualization in the model, ie. if an atom/a bond/an angle ... is selected then this object will be highlighted with a particular color in the 3D window, also the associated line in the selection dialog will be colored as well and using the same color. Each page will be briefly introduced thereafter. The \"Molecule(s)\" tab . The \"Molecule(s)\" tab, see figure 7.5, lists all the different molecules in the model: . Figure 7.5: \"Molecule(s)\" tab in the DL-POLY calculation assistant. Each line corresponds to a molecule, and for each molecule the information is as follow: . | ID in the force field . | Name in the force field (can be changed by double clicking on the line) . | Multiplicity (number of times the same molecule appears in the model) . | Chemistry . | Total number of atoms . | Number of chemical species . | Check button to visualize the molecule in the model . | Check button to visualize the atom number within the molecule . | . In the \"Ni-Phth\" example used here, two distinct molecules are found, 8 identical and standard Ni-phthalocyanine molecules that constitute the bottom surface and 1 modified Ni-phthalocyanine molecule, with a H atom missing on top of it. As illustrated in figure 7.6 the effect of the first check button [vizm] is to help visualizing the different molecule(s) in the model. For each molecule a color is defined and applied to both the atom(s) in the model and the corresponding line in the \"Molecule(s)\" tab. Figure 7.6: Visualizing the \"Molecule(s)\" using the DL_POLY calculation assistant. Whereas as illustrated in figure 7.7 the effect of the second check button [vizn] is to help visualizing the atom numbers as assigned in the \"FIELD\" file, numbers range from 1 to the total number of atom(s) in the molecule. Figure 7.7: Visualizing the atom(s) number(s) within the \"Molecule(s)\", to clarify the representation a single fragment from the \"NiPhth\" example is displayed. Some mouse options are available in the \"Molecule(s)\" tab: . | Double click anywhere on the line to edit the name of the molecule. | Use the right click to open the contextual menu to edit the name/add/remove molecule(s). | . As illustrated in figures 7.8 and 7.9 it is possible to add molecule(s) to the force field, or to merge existing molecules from the force field into a single description: . | Providing that the multiplicity of a molecule is higher than 1, and therefore than several identical molecular fragment exist, it is possible to split the existing molecule, preserving the old description for the non-selected fragment(s) and creating a copy for the selected fragment(s). This process is illustrated in figure 7.8. | Providing that some molecules in the force field have the same chemistry and connectivity it is possible to merge the description this two separates molecules as one. This process is illustrated in figure 7.9. | . Figure 7.8: Adding molecules to the force field using the DL_POLY calculation assistant. Figure 7.9: Merging molecules from the force field using the DL_POLY calculation assistant. The \"Atom(s)\" tab . When molecules have been properly defined, the next tab allows to configure the atom(s) description, this has to be done for each molecule: . Figure 7.10: The \"Atom(s)\" tab in the DL-POLY assistant. As illustrated in figure 7.10 the first element to notice in the \"Atom(s)\" tab is the combo box for the choice of the molecule to work on, that same combo box will be inserted in any tab dedicated to intra-molecular interactions. Each line corresponds to a particular atom for the molecule specified above, and for each atom the information is as follow: . | ID in the molecule . | Name in the molecule . | Element . | Mass . | Charge . | Number of frozen atoms for this type . | Total number of atoms for this type . | Check button to visualize the atom in the model . | . Figure 7.11: Inserting a new atom description in the \"Atom(s)\" tab. Figure 7.12: Merging two existing atom descriptions in the \"Atom(s)\" tab. Before editing an atom property it might be necessary to add or remove some atom types from the existing description, these actions are available using the mouse right button contextual menu. As illustrated in figure 7.11 it is possible to create a new type of atom from an existing atom type that contains more that 1 atom. And as illustrated in figure 7.12 it is possible to merge an existing atom description with any other atom type of the same chemical species. Whether it is for inserting or merging an atom it is important to specify that all existing atomic descriptions, a part for the new one or the one to be removed, will be preserved and thus that no information will be lost in this process. Editing an atom properties, by double clicking on the atom line or using the contextual menu, will open the \"Atom parameter(s)\" dialog: . Figure 7.13: Editing an atom description in the \"Atom(s)\" tab. The \"Field parameters\" combo allows to switch between \"Manual\" (user defined only) and \"Automatic\" force field parameters (if any available). By default the choice is set on \"Manual\" and the \"Force field type\" combo is inactive. The \"Frozen\" button allows to pick atom(s) to be frozen among the edited atom type (see figure 7.13). When selecting \"Automatic\" for the \"Field parameters\" combo, providing that some force field parameters are found \"Force field type\" combo becomes active and offers to choose between available description(s): . Figure 7.14: Choosing a force field description for the atom type in the \"Atom(s)\" tab. In this example available parameters are from the Amber 99 force field. As soon as a selection has been made a dialog (see fig. 7.15) pops up to update the \"FIELD\" file with the available parameters in the force field selected at the initializing stage of the assistant (Amber 99 in this example). Figure 7.15: The \"Update FIELD file with the force field parameters\" dialog. The number of lines in the table in figure 7.15 depends on both the option(s) (\"Flexible chemical bond(s), Bond angle(s) ...\") selected to create the \"FIELD\" file, the line will appears only if the option was selected, and the availability of the data for that particular type of atom in the selected force field. In this example all the properties presented were selected to create the \"FIELD\" file and some data exist in the force field for the \"CB\" atom type with each particular property. This dialog helps to update quickly any parameters to be used to create the \"FIELD\" file: . Figure 7.16: Updating parameters for the \"FIELD\" file, using field parameters for the \"CB\" atom(s) in the \"Amber 99\" force field. As illustrated in figure 7.16 to update any \"FIELD\" file value simply browse the property tree, select the desired force field parameters among available data, remember to check the \"update\" button at the end of the line, and finally pressed the \"Apply\" button. \"Core-shell unit(s)\" . Figure 7.17: \"Core-shell unit(s)\" tab in the \"DL-POLY\" assistant. \"Constraint bond(s)\" . Figure 7.18: \"Constrains bond(s)\" tab in the \"DL-POLY\" assistant. \"Mean force potential(s)\" . Figure 7.19: \"Mean force potential(s)\" tab in the \"DL-POLY\" assistant. \"Rigid unit(s)\" . Figure 7.20: \"Rigid unit(s)\" tab in the \"DL-POLY\" assistant. \"Tethering potential(s)\" . Figure 7.21: \"Tethering potential(s)\" tab in the \"DL-POLY\" assistant. \"Flexible chemical bond(s)\" and \"Bond restraint(s)\" . The tabs for the \"Flexible chemical bond(s)\" and the \"Bond restraint(s)\" being extremely similar, this manual presents only the part related to \"Flexible chemical bond(s)\". As illustrated in figure 7.22 the bonds, for the selected molecule, are listed by type depending on the nature of the field atoms involved, also for each type of bond it is possible to display every single bond in the molecule. Figure 7.22: \"Flexible chemical bond(s)\" tab in the \"DL-POLY\" assistant. Each line corresponds to a either to a bond type, or a particular bond, for the molecule specified above, and for each bond the information is as follow: . | ID in the molecule (if the line refers to a bond type). | Name for atom type 1 (bond type), or field number for atom 1 (bond). | Name for atom type 2 (bond type), or field number for atom 2 (bond). | Value measured in the model: average for all bonds for that type, or, value (or average if the multiplicity for the molecule is &gt; 1) for that particular bond. | Visualize all bonds of that type or that particular bond in the model. | Use to create the \"FIELD\" file, if not checked the bond / type will not be used. | Potential to use to describe all bonds of that type (\"Default:\" value) or that particular bond in the model. | Numerical value(s) for the parameters of the selected potential. | . The description of the bond(s) can be modified simultaneously for all bond(s) of the same type using the root line that type, or one by one by browsing the list and picking any line. It is therefore possible to choose a different parametrization for every single bond in the molecule. Some parameters can be modified directly in the table, otherwise a simple double click using the mouse left button will open the bond edition dialog illustrated in figure 7.23. Figure 7.23: \"Flexible chemical bond(s)\" edition dialog in the \"DL-POLY\" assistant. In figure 7.23 the \"Field parameters\" combo box presents the list of matching parameters, chemical species wise, found in the force field selected at the initialization stage. The next tabs of the assistant dedicated to intra-molecular properties are as follow: . | \"Bond angle(s)\" . | \"Angular restraint(s)\" . | \"Dihedral angle(s)\" . | \"Torsional restraint(s)\" . | \"Improper angle(s)\" . | \"Inversion angle(s)\" . | . For all these properties the philosophy is similar to the one presented above for the \"Flexible chemical bond(s)\". Hence will only briefly illustrate the different tabs without more details. \"Bond angle(s)\" and \"Angular restraint(s)\" . Figure 7.24: \"Bond angle(s)\" tab in the \"DL-POLY\" assistant. \"Dihedral angle(s)\" and \"Torsional restraint(s)\" .

Figure 7.33: \"External field(s)\" tab in the \"DL-POLY\" assistant. \"Preview\" . At any time when using the \"DL-POLY\" assistant, the \"Preview\" button allows open the \"DL-POLY files preview\" dialog, to visualize the \"CONTROL\", \"FIELD\" and \"CONFIG\" file(s). Figure 7.34: \"DL-POLY files preview\" dialog in the \"DL-POLY\" assistant. The \"DL-POLY files preview\" dialog (fig. 7.34) contains a notebook with up to 3 tabs depending on the file(s) to be created. Each tab presents the content of a file, \"CONTROL\", \"FIELD\" or \"CONFIG\", and highlights option(s) and keyword(s) using color(s) and font layout option(s). Finalizing the assistant and file(s) creation . When pressing the \"Apply\" button on the file tab of the assistant, the user is asked to selected a folder. \"CONTROL\", \"FIELD\" and \"CONFIG\" if selected, will be created in the selected directory. Following the file(s) creation or if the assistant is closed anyway, the \"DL-POLY\" force field data will be preserved. Therefore allowing the re-open the assistant later for further modifications. All existing force field data can also saved in the atomes project and/or workspace files, simply remember to save your work. ",

    "content": "Figure 5.2: The \"OpenGL\" menu and the attached submenus. The \"OpenGL\" menu is detailed in figure 5.2. The behavior of the \"Render\" menu [Fig. 5.2-c], and the \"Quality\" menu [Fig. 5.2-d], as well as of the \"Render image\" button being pretty intuitive the following only detail the behavior of the \"Style menu\", the \"Color scheme(s)\" menu [Fig. 5.2-b], and the \"Material and lights\" button. The \"Style\" menu . Using the \"Style\" menu it is possible to define to default style of the model representation, the options are among the most commonly used in chemistry. Changing the default style from this menu will update several parts of the OpenGL window and associated menus. For instance selecting the \"Ball and stick\" option will update the first tab of \"Atom(s) configuration\" dialog [Fig. 5.6] to display atomic radius and the \"Bond(s)\" menu [Fig. 5.5] to present the \"Radius(ii)\" and offer a shortcut to modify their values. It is possible to define local style(s) to improve the visual representation, however this is only possible using the mouse, see section 5.2.2.1, and changing the default style of the model using the \"Style\" menu will reset/erase any local style(s) value(s) to the default. The \"Color scheme(s)\" menu . In the atomes program when the file is opened most of the bonding properties are calculated \"on-the-fly\", allowing to gain insights on the atomic coordinations, as well as the number of fragments and the different molecules in the model. Therefore before using the \"Color scheme(s)\" menu it is important to be familiar with the following definitions: . | Total coordination = total number of first neighbor atoms around the atom. | Partial coordination = number of atoms of each chemical species around the atom. | Fragments = isolated molecular objects in the model. | Molecules = the different topological objects in the model. | Coordination polyhedra = structure drawn by linking the atoms of the first coordination sphere for a particular atom. Requires the considered atom to have 3 neighbors, then the atom it-self is used as a point to build the polyhedra, or more. | . The \"Color scheme(s)\" menu allows to change the Color Map (CM) for both atoms and coordination polyhedra, based on the bonding analysis performed using the bond cutoff(s) specified by the user. An illustration is provided in figure 5.3 for the \"Ni-Phth\" project of the example workspace, note that is this model the molecule on the top is missing a hydrogen atom compared to the one that composed the surface. The colors of each objects can be modified/adapted via the appropriate menus/dialogs (see sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.3). Figure 5.3: The standard Colors Maps (CM) for the atoms accessible using the \"Color scheme(s)\" menu. Top standard colors using the chemical species, a) Total coordinations as CM, b) Partial coordinations as CM, c) Fragments as CM and d) Molecules as CM. Using a custom color map . Alternatively to the CMs proposed by the atomes program it is possible to apply a user defined CM to the OpenGL model, this option is accessible via the \"Custom\" button of the \"Atoms &amp; bonds\" menu [Fig. 5.2-b]. In that case it is required to read a file (having the extension \"*.dat\") that contains the numerical data to be used as color scale. This file must be a simple (Unix like) text file with as many lines as: . Total number of MD steps \\(\\times\\) Total number of atoms . Indeed the new colors can be applied to the entire MD trajectory. An example is provided hereafter for the silica glass model: . | In the initial setup the chemical species are used as color map: . | When the \"Custom\" button is pressed for the atoms CMs, the \"Custom color map setup\" dialog appears: . | (a) The \"Import / Save data\" button allows to import your data file to create the color map. If the data file is processed successfully then atomes will propose to use it and a confirmation dialog will pop-up: . For this example the data points are simply the atom indices from 1 to 3000. | (b) Afterwards using the \"Edit data\" button it becomes possible to edit the data in a basic spreadsheet like mode, so that values for a particular atom can be checked and/or modify if needed: . | (c) And using the \"Customize color map\" button is possible to customize the color map, initially a gradient of red an blue between the maxima and the minima of the values in the data set is used, but you can easily add or remove point(s), and adjust the corresponding color to enhance the visual representation of your model: . | | \\(\\Longrightarrow\\) | | . | Finally simply apply the changes to use the new colors: . | The \"Custom\" data and the corresponding color map are saved within the atomes project and workspace files (see sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3), so that it will not be require to load a prepare the color map between work sessions. | . Material and lights . The \"Material and lights\" button of the \"OpenGL\" menu opens the \"OpenGL material aspect and light settings\" dialog [Fig. 5.4]: . Figure 5.4: The \"OpenGL material aspect and light settings\" dialog in the atomes program. The window contains a notebook with 3 tabs: . | The first tab allows to configure/adjust: . | The quality of the rendering, ie. the number of polygons to render a volume. | The lightning model, from the lowest quality (fastest to render, \"None\") to the highest quality (longer to render, \"Cook-Torrance-GCX\"). | The material aspect, few templates being available, but all characteristics required to describe the material aspect for the light mode being available. | . | The second tab allows to configure the lights sources of the model: . | 3 type of light source being available: directional, point and spot lights. | With the possibility to add up to 10 light sources. | . | Finally the third tab is used to adjust the fog effects . | .

    "content": "King’s shortest paths criterion . The first way to define a ring has been given by Shirley V. King [1] (and later by Franzblau [2]). In order to study the connectivity of glassy SiO\\(_2\\) she defines a ring as the shortest path between two of the nearest neighbors of a given node [Fig. 5.13]. Figure 5.13: King’s criterion in the ring statistics: a ring represents the shortest path between two of the nearest neighbors (N1 and N2) of a given node (At). In the case of the King’s criterion one can calculate the maximum number of different ring sizes, \\(NS_{max}(KSP)\\), which can be found using the atom At to initiate the search: \\[\\label{lmaxsp} NS_{max}(KSP)\\ =\\ \\frac{Nc({\\textbf{At}}) \\times (Nc({\\textbf{At}})-1)}{2}\\] where \\(N_c({\\textbf{At}})\\) is the number of neighbors of atom At. \\(NS_{max}(KSP)\\) represents the number of ring sizes found if all couples of neighbors of atom At are connected together with paths of different sizes. It is also possible to calculate the theoretical maximum size, \\(TMS(KSP)\\), of a King’s shortest path ring in the network using: \\[\\label{tmsking} TMS(KSP)\\ = 2\\ \\times\\ (D_{max}\\ -\\ 2)\\ \\times (Nc_{max}\\ -\\ 2)\\ +\\ 2\\ \\times\\ D_{max}\\] where \\(D_{max}\\) is the longest distance, in number of chemical bonds, separating two atoms in the network, and \\(Nc_{max}\\) represents the average number of neighbors of the chemical species of higher coordination. If used when looking for rings, periodic boundary conditions have to be taken into account to calculate \\(D_{max}\\). The relation [Eq. [tmsking]] is illustrated in figure 5.16-2). Guttman’s shortest paths criterion . A later definition of ring was proposed by Guttman [3], who defines a ring as the shortest path which comes back to a given node (or atom) from one of its nearest neighbors [Fig. 5.14]. Figure 5.14: Guttman’s criterion in the ring statistics: a ring represents the shortest path which comes back to a given node (At) from one of its nearest neighbors (N). Differences between the King and the Guttman’s shortest paths criteria are illustrated in figure 5.15. Figure 5.15: Differences between the King and the Guttman shortest paths criteria for the ring statistics in an AB\\(_2\\) system. In these two examples the search is initiated from chemical species A (blue square). The nearest neighbor(s) of chemical species B (green circles) are used to continue the analysis. 1) In the first example only rings with 4 nodes are found using the Guttman’s criterion, whereas rings with 18 nodes are also found using the King’s criterion (2\\(^9\\) rings with 18 nodes). 2) In the second example the King’s shortest path criterion allows to find the ring with 8 nodes ignored by the Guttman’s criterion which is only able to find the rings with 6 nodes. Like for the King’s criterion, with the Guttman’s criterion one can calculate the maximum number of different ring sizes, \\(NS_{max}(GSP)\\), which can be found using the atom At to initiate the search: \\[NS_{max}(GSP) = N_c({\\textbf{At}}) - 1\\] where \\(N_c({\\textbf{At}})\\) is the number of neighbors of atom At. \\(NS_{max}(GSP)\\) represents the number of ring sizes found if the neighbors of atom At are connected together with paths of different sizes. It is also possible to calculate the Theoretical Maximum Size, \\(TMS(GSP)\\), of a Guttman’s ring in the network using: \\[\\label{tmsg} TMS(GSP)\\ = 2\\ \\times\\ D_{max}\\] where \\(D_{max}\\) represents the longest distance, in number of chemical bonds, separating two atoms in the network. If used when looking for rings, periodic boundary conditions have to be taken into account to calculate \\(D_{max}\\). The relation [Eq. [tmsg]] is illustrated in figure 5.16-1. Figure 5.16: Theoretical maximum size of the rings for an AB\\(_2\\) system (\\(Nc_{max}~=~Nc_{A}~=~4\\)) and using: 1) the Guttman’s criterion, 2) the King’s criterion. The theoretical maximum size represent the longest distance between two nearest neighbors 1 and 2 (green circles) of the atom At used to initiate the search (blue square). Since the introduction of the King’s and the Guttman’s criteria other definitions of rings have been proposed. These definitions are based on the properties of the rings to be decomposed into the sum of smaller rings. The primitive rings criterion . A ring is primitive [4], [5] (or Irreducible [6]) if it can not be decomposed into two smaller rings [Fig. 5.17]. Figure 5.17: Primitive rings in the ring statistics: the ’AC’ ring defined by the sum of the A and the C paths is primitive only if there is no B path shorter than A and shorter than C which allows to decompose the ’AC’ ring into two smaller rings ’AB’ and ’AC’. The primitive rings analysis between the paths in figure 5.17 may lead to 3 results depending on the relations between the paths A, B, and C: . | If paths A, B, and C have the same length: A = B = C then the rings ’AB’, ’AC’ and ’BC’ are primitives. | If the relation between the paths is like \\(?=?&lt;?\\) (ex: A = B &lt; C) then 1 smaller ring (’AB’) and 2 bigger rings (’AC’ and ’BC’) exist. None of these rings can be decomposed into the sum of two smaller rings therefore the 3 rings are again primitives. | If the relation between the path is like \\(?&lt;?=?\\) (ex: A &lt; B = C) or \\(?&lt;?&lt;?\\) (ex: A &lt; B &lt; C) then a shortest path exists (A). It will be possible to decompose the ring (’BC’) built without this shortest path into the sum of 2 smaller rings (’AB’ and ’AC’), therefore this ring will not be primitive. | . The strong rings criterion . The strong rings [4], [5] are defined by extending the definition of primitive rings. A ring is strong if it can not be decomposed into a sum of smaller rings whatever this sum is, ie. whatever the number of paths in the decomposition is. Figure 5.18: Strong rings in the ring statistics: a) the 9-carbon-atoms ring created after breaking a C-C bond in a Buckminster fulleren molecule is a counterexample of strong ring; b) the combination of shortest rings, 11 5-carbon-atoms rings and 19 6-carbon-atoms rings, appears easily after the deformation of the C\\(_{60}\\) molecule. By definition the strong rings are also primitives, therefore to search for strong rings can be summed as to find the strong rings among the primitive rings. This technique is limited to relatively simple cases, like crystals or structures such as the one illustrated in figure 5.18. On the one hand the CPU time needed to complete such an analysis for amorphous systems is very important. On the other hand it is not possible to search for strong rings using the same search depth than for other types of rings. The strong ring analysis is indeed diverging which makes it very complex to implement for amorphous materials. In the case of primitive rings like in the case of strong rings, there is no theoretical maximum size of rings in the network. | S. V. King, Nat., vol. 213, p. 1112, 1967. | D. S. Franzblau, Phys.

    "title": "Partial structure factors",
    "content": "There are a few, somewhat different definitions of partials \\(S(q)\\) used in practice, and computed by atomes . Faber-Ziman definition/formalism . One way used to define the partial structure factors has been proposed by Faber and Ziman [1]. In this approach the structure factor is represented by the correlations between the different chemical species. To describe the correlation between the \\(\\alpha\\) and the \\(\\beta\\) chemical species the partial structure factor \\(S^{FZ}_{\\alpha \\beta}(q)\\) is defined by: \\[\\label{sqp0} S^{FZ}_{\\alpha \\beta}(q)\\ =\\ 1\\ +\\ 4 \\pi \\rho \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\ dr\\ r^{2}\\ \\frac{\\sin qr}{qr}\\ \\left(g_{\\alpha \\beta}(r)-1\\right)\\] where the \\(g_{\\alpha \\beta}(r)\\) are the partial radial distribution functions [Eq. [g2r_4]]. The total structure factor is then obtained by the relation: \\[\\label{sqp1} S(q)\\ =\\ \\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\ c_{\\alpha} b_{\\alpha}\\ c_{\\beta} b_{\\beta}\\ \\left[S^{FZ}_{\\alpha \\beta}(q)\\ -\\ 1\\right]\\] . Ashcroft-Langreth definition/formalism . In a similar approach, based on the correlation between the chemical species, and developed by Ashcroft and Langreth [2], [3], [4], the partial structure factors \\(S^{AL}_{\\alpha \\beta}(q)\\) are defined by: \\[\\label{sqp2} S^{AL}_{\\alpha \\beta}(q)\\ =\\ \\delta_{\\alpha \\beta}\\ +\\ 4 \\pi \\rho \\left({c_\\alpha c_\\beta}\\right)^{1/2}\\ \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\ dr\\ r^{2}\\ \\frac{\\sin qr}{qr}\\ \\left(g_{\\alpha \\beta}(r)-1\\right)\\] where \\(\\delta_{\\alpha \\beta}\\) is the Kronecker delta, \\(c_\\alpha = \\displaystyle{\\frac{N_\\alpha}{N}}\\), and the \\(g_{\\alpha \\beta}(r)\\) are the partial radial distribution functions [Eq. [g2r_4]]. Then the total structure factor can be calculated using: \\[\\label{sqp3} S(q)\\ =\\ \\frac{\\displaystyle{\\sum_{\\alpha, \\beta}}\\ b_\\alpha b_\\beta\\ \\left({c_\\alpha c_\\beta}\\right)^{1/2}\\ \\left[S^{AL}_{\\alpha \\beta}(q)\\ +\\ 1\\right]}{\\displaystyle\\sum_{\\alpha}\\ c_\\alpha b_\\alpha^2}\\] . Bhatia-Thornton definition/formalism . In this approach, used in the case of binary systems AB\\(_x\\) [5] only, the total structure factor \\(S(q)\\) can be express as the weighted sum of 3 partial structure factors: \\[\\label{sqp4} S(q)= \\frac{\\langle b \\rangle^2 S_{NN}(q) + 2\\langle b \\rangle(b_\\text{A} -b_\\text{B})S_{NC}(q) + (b_\\text{A}-b_\\text{B})^2S_{CC}(q) - (c_\\text{A} b_\\text{A}^2 + c_\\text{B} b_\\text{B}^2)}{\\langle b \\rangle^2}\\ +\\ 1\\] where \\(\\langle b \\rangle = c_\\text{A} b_\\text{A} + c_\\text{B} b_\\text{B}\\), with \\(c_\\text{A}\\) and \\(b_\\text{A}\\) representing respectively the concentration and the scattering length of species \\(\\text{A}\\). \\(S_{NN}(q)\\), \\(S_{NC}(q)\\) and \\(S_{CC}(q)\\) represent combinations of the partial structure factors calculated using the Faber-Ziman formalism and weighted using the concentrations of the 2 chemical species: \\[\\label{sqp5} S_{NN}(q) = \\sum_{\\text{A}=1}^{2} \\sum_{\\text{B}=1}^{2} c_{\\text{A}} c_{\\text{B}} S^{FZ}_{\\text{A} \\text{B}}(q)\\] \\[\\label{sqp6} S_{NC}(q) = c_{\\text{A}} c_{\\text{B}} \\times \\left[\\ c_\\text{A}\\times\\left(S^{FZ}_{\\text{A}\\text{A}}(q) - S^{FZ}_{\\text{A} \\text{B}}(q)\\right)\\ -\\ c_{\\text{B}}\\times\\left(S^{FZ}_{\\text{B}\\text{B}}(q) - S^{FZ}_{\\text{A} \\text{B}}(q)\\right)\\ \\right]\\] \\[\\label{sqp7} S_{CC}(q) = c_{\\text{A}} c_{\\text{B}} \\times \\left[ 1 + c_{\\text{A}} c_{\\text{B}} \\times \\left[ \\sum_{\\text{A}=1}^{2} \\sum_{\\text{B}\\ne\\text{A}}^{2} \\left( S^{FZ}_{\\text{A}\\text{A}}(q) - S^{FZ}_{\\text{A}\\text{B}}(q) \\right)\\right] \\right]\\] . \\(\\bullet\\) \\(S_{NN}(q)\\) is the Number-Number partial structure factor. Its Fourier transform allows to obtain a global description of the structure of the solid, ie. of the distribution of the experimental scattering centers, or atomic nuclei, positions. The nature of the chemical species spread in the scattering centers is not considered. Furthermore if \\(b_\\text{A} =b_\\text{B}\\) then \\(S_{NN}(q) = S(q)\\). \\(\\bullet\\) \\(S_{CC}(q)\\) is the Concentration-Concentration partial structure factor. Its Fourier transform allows to obtain an idea of the distribution of the chemical species over the scattering centers described using the \\(S_{NN}(q)\\). Therefore the \\(S_{CC}(q)\\) describes the chemical order in the material. In the case of an ideal binary mixture of 2 chemical species \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)2, \\(S_{CC}(q)\\) is constant and equal to \\(c_Ac_B\\). In the case of an ordered chemical mixture (chemical species with distinct diameters, and with heteropolar and homopolar chemical bonds) it is possible to link the variations of the \\(S_{CC}(q)\\) to the product of the concentrations of the 2 chemical species of the mixture: . | \\(S_{CC}(q) = c_Ac_B\\): random distribution. | \\(S_{CC}(q) &gt; c_Ac_B\\): homopolar atomic correlations (A-A, B-B) preferred. | \\(S_{CC}(q) &lt; c_Ac_B\\): heteropolar atomic correlations (A-B) preferred. | \\(\\langle b \\rangle = 0\\): \\(S_{CC}(q) = S(q)\\). | . \\(\\bullet\\) \\(S_{NC}(q)\\) is the Number-Concentration partial structure factor. Its Fourier transform allows to obtain a correlation between the scattering centers and their occupation by a given chemical species. The more the chemical species related partial structure factors are different (\\(S_{AA}(q) \\ne S_{BB}(q)\\)) and the more the oscillations are important in the \\(S_{NC}(q)\\). In the case of an ideal mixture \\(S_{NC}(q) = 0\\), and all the information about the structure of the system is given by the \\(S_{NN}(q)\\). If we consider the binary mixture as an ionic mixture then it is possible to calculate the Charge-Charge \\(S_{ZZ}(q)\\) and the Number-Charge \\(S_{NZ}(q)\\) partial structure factors using the Concentration-Concentration \\(S_{CC}(q)\\) and the Number-Concentration \\(S_{NC}(q)\\): \\[\\label{sqp8} S_{ZZ}(q) = \\frac{S_{CC}(q)}{c_A c_B} \\qquad and \\qquad S_{NZ}(q) = \\frac{S_{NC}(q)}{c_B/Z_A}\\] \\(c_A\\) and \\(Z_A\\) represent the concentration and the charge of the chemical species A, the global neutrality of the system must be respected therefore \\(c_AZ_A + c_BZ_B=0\\).

The bottom parts of the object contextual menus in figure 5.21 are almost identical, and contain a list of submenus dedicated to several actions that could be performed in relation to the object, atom or chemical bond, of the contextual menu. The construction of each submenu follow a similar pattern presented bellow. Construction of the submenus . Figure 5.22: Construction of the submenus attached to the object contextual menu. If the action proposed by the submenu can be applied to this atom/bond then the first element of the menu is a line with the name of this atom/bond [Fig. 5.22-a]. The second line [Fig. 5.22-b] refers, depending on the action of the submenu and/or the status of the atom, to \"selected\" or \"non-selected\" atoms. The third line [Fig. 5.22-c] follows the same idea for the \"labelled\" or \"non-labelled\" atoms. Finally the bottom part [Fig. 5.22-c] refers to the coordinations and the chemistry of the considered object. Most of the actions provided by these submenus being very intuitive, only the \"Style\" and \"Edit as new project\" menus will be introduced in detail thereafter. The \"Style\" submenu . The \"Style\" submenu(s) of the object contextual menu allows to change the visual style locally, ie. for an atom/bond, or any particular set of atom and bonds in the model. Figure 5.23: The object contextual menu and the \"Style\" submenu(s). Overall using local style(s) allows to improve the visual representation and to highlights particular element(s) [Fig. 5.24]. Figure 5.24: Multiple visual styles the atomes program. The parameters of the local style(s), are inherited from the global style (see section 5.1.1.1). Therefore in order to modify any parameters of a particular style, ie. the sphere radius of an atom for the \"Ball and stick\" style, this style must be applied globally, and the appropriate parameters modified using the \"model\" menu (see section 5.1.2) or the \"Atom(s) configuration\" dialog (Fig. 5.6). Afterwards and when applied locally the \"Ball and stick\" style will use the new parameters. Note that the default atomic radius for the \"Spacefilled\" style, even is this style is not used, is the \"Covalent\" radius, following the local style menu’s behavior and if the global \"Spacefilled\" style was not changed, then the local \"Spacefilled\" style(s) will use the same parameters. The \"Copy\" submenu . The \"Copy\" submenu(s) of the object contextual menu allows to copy atomic coordinates, the copied data could then be re-used either using the \"Model edition\" dialog (see section 6.1.3) or the mouse \"Edition mode\" (see section 6.2). Figure 5.25: The object contextual menu and the \"Copy\" submenu(s). Data can copied from any project, even from an MD trajectory however in that case only the atomic coordinates from the visible MD step will be copied, other will be ignored. Data can only be pasted in project(s) that support the \"Edition mode\" (see chapter 6). The \"Edit as new project\" submenu . The \"Edit as new project\" submenu(s) of the object contextual menu allows to create a new project using any particular set of atom and bonds in the model. Figure 5.26: The object contextual menu and the \"Edit as new project\" submenu(s). Using any button of this menu the corresponding set of atom(s)/bond(s) will be copied and exported as a new atomes project. This new project will immediately be inserted in the workspace tree to be available for further work and a corresponding 3D window will pop-up. Parameters of the initial project will be applied to the new one (style, colors ...), except for the periodicity, if any, that will be lost in the process. An example is proposed thereafter: . | For this example the King’s rings statistics analysis (see section 5.5) was performed on SiO\\(_2\\) test system, afterwards the \"Advanced environment\" dialog was opened and all atom(s) involved in ring(s) of size 6 atoms were selected (selection is highlighted in light blue): . | After the selection, the object contextual menu is used to \"Edit as new project\" the list of \"All selected atom(s)/bond(s)\": . | The new project \"Project N°4\" that contains the appropriate atom(s)/bond(s) is created and inserted in the workspace tree, and the new OpenGL window pops up: . | Finally after restoring the periodicity, it is possible to calculate any other properties for the new model, ie. the selection from the SiO\\(_2\\) model, and compare the results with one for the original system: . | .

Figure 6.11: Accessing the \"Model edition\" window in the atomes program. It is not possible to access the \"Model edition\", and therefore to move / replace / remove and insert atom(s) in the case of MD trajectory. Selection process . When the \"Atom edition\" window is opened the main OpenGL window remains active, and it is still possible to work in it. However having the \"Model edition\" window opened will modify the results of the atom selection process, whether is it performed using any dialog window or using with the mouse describe in section 5.2.1 and 5.2.2. The newly extra-selected atom(s) will be covered in pink (instead of light blue), see [Fig. 6.12], and even already selected atoms (in light blue) can be re-selected. Figure 6.12: Modified selection process when the \"Model edition\" window is opened. As long as the \"Model edition\" window remains open, the \"Measures\" dialog [Fig. 5.10] will only presented measurement(s) related to the new pink atoms. The utilization and purpose of this extra selection feature will be illustrated when presenting the action tabs of the \"Model edition\" window. General behavior . Before browsing each and every tab of the \"Model edition\" window it is required to introduce the \"atom search\" tool [Fig. 6.13] common to almost every tab (in the top part) in the window. Each tab being dedicated to a particular action the search tool will help to find and selected the atom(s) you want the action to be performed upon: . Figure 6.13: The atom(s) search tool. | Search for atom(s) among [Fig. 6.13-1]: . | non-selected atom(s) only: search only in \"All non-selected atoms\" [Fig. 6.13-1] . | selected atom(s) only: search only in \"All selected atoms\" [Fig. 6.13-1] . | or all atoms: search in all \"All atom(s)\" [Fig. 6.13-1] . | . [selao] is the default value for menu [Fig. 6.13-1] if some atoms are selected, and [allao] is the default value otherwise. | Apply the action to [Fig. 6.13-2]: . | The atoms as single object(s): pick \"Atom(s)\" [Fig. 6.13-2] . | Group of atom(s): pick \"Group of atoms\" [Fig. 6.13-2] . | . In case [isoat] the action will be performed on the atom(s) that will be selected and each of these atoms will be treated as an isolated object. In case [groat] the action will be performed on the group(s) of atoms, the atom(s) that will be selected afterwards belong to: entire coordination sphere(s), fragment(s) or molecule(s). | Filter the result of the search depending on the type of object you are interested in figure 6.13-3: . | Chemical species (Available only if [isoat] is selected for [Fig. 6.13-2]) . | Total coordination . | Partial coordination . | Fragment . | Molecule . | . Pick the appropriate value in figure 6.13-3 and the selection tree bellow will be updated accordingly. | Refine the search to present only the atom(s) of that particular chemical species (if [isoat] was selected in figure 6.13-2) or the group of atoms that contains such chemical species (if [groat] was selected in figure 6.13-2) . | . Notes: . | Clickable : some of the column headers in the search tree are clickable, in the top part if you click on the \"Label\" or \"Move\" the corresponding action will be applied / unapplied to the entire data set available in the search tree. | Update : whenever the values for the menus [for] [Fig. 6.13-2] and [fil] [Fig. 6.13-3] are modified the tree is not only refreshed but also cleaned, and so is the corresponding data thus previous selection sets would be lost in the process. | . Examples of the utilization of the \"atom search\" tool [Fig. 6.13] will be presented along with each actions available in the \"Model edition\" window. The \"Move\" tab . The \"Move\" tab allows to move atom(s) (translation only) or group of atoms (translation and rotation around the groups barycenter). In the following example one of the fragment in the model is selected, the fragment appears to be split because of the periodic boundary conditions: . Figure 6.14: Initial position with an isolated fragment selected in the model. To move the selected fragment: . | Open the \"Move\" atom(s) tab: . | Go back to the main OpenGL window, keeping the \"Model edition\" window opened, and select few atoms, that will appear in pink color. Then open the \"Measures\" dialog [Fig. 5.10] to select a bunch of measurements to be displayed: . | Go back to the \"Model edition\" window and adjust the search \"For\" option and select \"Group of atom(s)\": . | Adjust the search \"Filter by\" option and select \"Fragment\": . | Then select the fragment in the selection tree: . | Open the lower part(s) to move the fragment: . | . Figure 6.15: Final position of the fragment, after translation and rotation in the model. | Motion axis: it is possible to select (and visualize) the motion axis and choose between the \"Eye (viewer) axis\" and the \"Model axis\" (real x, y and z of the atoms). | Motion actions: the motion interactors (ranges and input entries) allow to adjust motion very precisely, slightly more approximate motion is also available using the mouse (see Sec. 6.2) . | Measurements: if already present in the OpenGL window, measurement(s) are updated on the fly, allowing to adjust perfectly position and orientation of the object in the model, see [Fig. 6.15]. | Motions: translation is always available, however rotation is only available for \"Group of atom(s)\" and is performed around the barycenter(s) of the object(s) to be rotated. | Reconstruction: the check button labelled \"Extract/rebuild the object(s) to be moved, ie. cut/clean bonds with nearest neighbor(s)\" offers the following option: . | For \"Atom(s)\": if activated the object(s) to be moved will be extracted from the model and translated independently, otherwise chemical bond(s) will simply be stretched. | For \"Group of atom(s)\": if activated the atomic positions of the object(s) will be corrected to get only single piece object(s). | . As illustrated in figure 6.14 the fragment visually appears in 2 pieces, and as illustrated by the example as a single piece object after motion [Fig. 6.15]. If the object(s) to be moved are coordination spheres and if the spheres that are being moved share atom(s), then the positions of these atoms might be affected twice by this procedure, leading to an awkward, yet correct, 3D representation. | Bonding: During motion, the coordination information is modified, all related menus and corresponding dialogs are updated accordingly, however detailed bonding information is lost. It is therefore strongly recommended to recompute bonding properties afterwards. | . The \"Replace\" tab . The \"Replace\" tab allows to replace object(s), atom(s) or group of atoms, by either: atom(s), molecules imported from the internal library or atom(s) imported from any project opened within the same instance of the atomes program: . Figure 6.16: The \"Replace\" tab, with the option of replace objects \"Normally\", ie. object by object, or \"Randomly\", in the model. As illustrated in figure 6.16 it is possible to replace object(s) one by one (\"Normally\") or by random pick (\"Randomly\"). The difference between the normal and the random search trees are illustrated in top part of figure 6.17. For normal substitution(s) [Fig. 6.17-a] it is possible to select the replacement object(s) either at once for all objects, using the \"Select for all ...\" menu, or alternatively one by one when browsing the tree and using the \"Select ...\" menu(s). For random substitution(s) [Fig. 6.17-b] only a single replacement is selected for each type of object, and it is require to enter the number of substitution(s) to be performed. The substitution options accessible using the \"Select ...\" menu are illustrated in the bottom part in figure 6.17 with the different \"atoms\" c), \"Library\" d) and \"Import from project\" e) submenus. Figure 6.17: Top: search trees a) replacing object(s) one by one, b) replacing object(s) randomly. Bottom: the \"Select for ...\" replacement menu and the attached c) \"Atom\", d) \"Library\", e) \"Import from project\" and f) \"Copied data\" submenus. Substitution options . | The \"Atom\" submenu [Fig. 6.17-c], to insert a new atom in place of the object(s) to be removed. Some shortcuts are proposed, if required the \"Other ...\" button allows to open a periodic table to pick any appropriate atom: . | The \"Library\" submenu [Fig. 6.17-d], to insert an new molecule in place of the object(s) to be removed. Some shortcuts are proposed as well, and the \"More ...\" button allows to open the \"Library\" dialog: . The \"Library\" dialog provides a bunch of sample molecules roughly sorted by chemical properties (see appendix 3 for more details). | The \"Import from project\" submenu [Fig. 6.17-e], to insert atom(s) from any atomes project opened in the workspace. | The \"Copied data\" button [Fig. 6.17-f], to copied data selection from any workspace in atomes. | . An example is provided in figure 6.18 with the random substitution of 500 \"Si\" atoms from the \"SiO2\" project by \"water\" molecules. Figure 6.18: Random substitution of 500 \"Si\" atoms by \"water\" molecules. | Irreversible: the replacement is irreversible (at least not directly, but it is always possible to perform another backward substitution) therefore remember to save your work before replacing any object(s) in your model. | Selection: At the end of the substitution process, and therefore after the insertion of the new objects, all these new objects will appear surrounded by light blue color in the OpenGL window (see figure 6.18), and will therefore be selected, making further work on these new objects easier. | Barycenters: the new object is inserted and centered at the barycenter of the atomic positions of the old object to be removed. | . The \"Remove\" tab . The \"Remove\" tab allows to remove object(s), atom(s) or group of atoms, like for the \"Replace\" tab the action can also be performed randomly. An example is provided in figure 6.19 with the normal (one by one) removal of all \"Ni-[N4]\" coordination spheres atoms from the \"Ni-Phth\" project: for a Nickel atom, this means that this \"Ni\" atom as well as it surrounding \"N\" neighbours are all removed. Figure 6.19: Normal removal of all \"Ni-[N4]\" coordination spheres from the model. The \"Insert\" tab . The \"Insert\" tab allows to insert new object(s) in the model: . Figure 6.20: The \"Insert\" tab, with the options to choose the object to be inserted and the position of insertion. The \"Select ...\" menu reproduces the one from the \"Replace\" tab, see the bottom part in figure 6.17, and allows to insert atom(s) [Fig. 6.17-c], molecular fragment(s) [Fig. 6.17-d] and atom(s) from any other project opened in the workspace [Fig. 6.17-e]. Selecting any object to insert will populate and update the tree bellow, with a new line. Each line describes the object to be inserted, and offers options to confirm the insertion and specify the position where to insert the object in the model. An example is provided in figure 6.21 where a fullerene \"C240\" is inserted in the \"Ni-Phth\" project modified after the removal example illustrated in figure 6.19. Figure 6.21: Insertion of fullerene \"C240\" in the \"Ni-Phth\" project modified after the removal example illustrated in figure 6.19. | Irreversible: the insertion is irreversible (at least not directly, but it is always possible to remove all inserted atoms) therefore remember to save your work before inserting any object(s) in your model. | Selection: After the insertion of the new objects, all these new objects will appear surrounded by light blue color (see figure 6.21)in the OpenGL window, and will therefore be selected, making further work on these new objects easier. | Position: the coordinates (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) always refers to the center of the model, ie. the barycenter of all existing atomic coordinates. | . The \"Random move\" tab . The \"Random move\" tab allows to disorder the model: . Figure 6.22: The \"Random move\" tab. With \"atom(s)\" selected as object(s) it is only possible to translate randomly, with \"Group of atoms\" it is also possible to rotate randomly and the corresponding column appears in the search tree. An example is provided in figure 6.23 with the random rotation of \"water\" molecules in the modified \"SiO2\" project after the substitution example illustrated in figure 6.18. Indeed after the substitution \"water\" molecules were all perfectly aligned, to correct this unlikely organization atomes can rotate randomly and independently every water molecule in the model: . | After the substitution all the \"H\" and \"O\" atoms of the newly inserted \"water\" molecules are selected, so search for selected atom(s) only [Fig. 6.13-1]. | Then choose to apply the action to \"Group of atoms\" [Fig. 6.13-2]. | Filter the selection using the \"Fragment\" option [Fig. 6.13-3]. | After the steps [ran1], [ran2] and [ran3] the selection tree will correspond to the one in figure 6.23.

    "content": "Ring statistics are mainly used to obtain a snapshot of the connectivity of a network. Thereby the better the snapshot will be, the better the description and the understanding of the properties of the material will be. In the literature many papers present studies of materials using ring statistics. In these studies either the number of Rings per Node ’\\(R_N\\)’ [1], [2] or the number of Rings per Cell ’\\(R_C\\)’ [3], [4], [5] are given as a result of the analysis. The first (\\(R_N\\)) is calculated for one node by counting all the rings corresponding to the property we are looking for (King’s, Guttman’s, primitive or strong ring criterion). The second (\\(R_C\\)) is calculated by counting all the different rings corresponding at least once (at least for one node) to the property we are looking for (King’s, shortest path, primitive or strong ring criterion). The values of \\(R_N\\) and \\(R_C\\) are often reduced to the number of nodes of the networks. Furthermore the results are presented according to each size of rings. An example is proposed with a very simple network illustrated in figure 5.19. Figure 5.19: A very simple network. This network is composed of 10 nodes, arbitrary of the same chemical species, and 7 bonds. Furthermore it is clear that in this network there are 1 ring with 3 nodes and 1 ring with 4 nodes. It is easy to calculate \\(R_N\\) and \\(R_C\\) for the network in figure 5.19 (\\(n\\) = number of nodes): .

Table 5.2: \\(R_C\\) for the network in figure 5.19 | \\(n\\) | \\(R_C(n)\\) | . | 3 | 3/10 | . | 4 | 4/10 | . In the literature the values of \\(R_N\\) and \\(R_C\\) are usually given separately [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Nevertheless these two properties are not sufficient in order to describe a network using rings. A simple example is proposed in figure 5.20. Figure 5.20: Two simple networks having very close compositions: 10 nodes and 7 links. The two networks [Fig. 5.20-a] and [Fig. 5.20-b] do have very similar compositions with 10 nodes and 7 links but they are clearly different. Nevertheless the previous definitions of rings per cell and rings per node even taken together will lead to the same description for these two different networks [Tab. 5.3]. Table 5.3: \\(R_N\\) calculated for the networks illustrated in figure 5.20. | \\(n\\) | \\(R_N(n)\\) | . | 3 | 1/10 | . | 4 | 1/10 | .

In both cases a) and b) there are 1 ring with 3 nodes and 1 ring with 4 nodes. It has to be noticed that these two rings have properties which correspond to each of the definitions introduced previously (King, Guttman, primitive and strong). Thus none of these definitions is able to help to distinguish between these two networks. Therefore even though these simple networks are different, the previous definitions lead to the same description. Thereby it is justified to wonder about the interpretation of the data presented in the literature for amorphous systems with a much higher complexity. | J. P. Rino, I. Ebbsjö, R. K. Kalia, A.

    "title": "Rings and connectivity: the R.I.N.G.S. method implemented in atomes",
    "content": "In the atomes program the results of the ring statistics analysis are outputted following the new R.I.N.G.S. method [1], [2], this method is presented in the next pages. The first goal of ring statistics is to give a faithful description of the connectivity of a network and to allow to compare this information with others obtained for already existing structures. It is therefore important to find a guideline which allows to establish a distinction and then a comparison between networks studied using ring statistics. We propose thereafter a new method to achieve this goal. First of all we noticed fundamental points that must be considered to get a reliable and transferable method: . | The results must be reduced to the total number of nodes in the network. The nature of the nodes used to initiate the analysis when looking for rings will have a significant influence, therefore it is essential to reduce the results to a value for one node. Otherwise it would be impossible to compare the results to the ones obtained for systems made of nodes (particles) of different number and/or nature. | Different networks must be distinguishable whatever the method used to define a ring. Indeed it is essential for the result of the analysis to be trustworthy independently of the method used to define a ring (King, Guttman, primitives, strong). Furthermore this will allow to compare the results of these different ring statistics. | . Number of rings per cell ’\\(R_C\\)’ . We have already introduced this value, which is the first and the easiest way to compare networks using ring statistics. Figure 5.21: The first comparison element: the total number of rings in the network. Table 5.5: Number of rings in the simple networks represented in figure 5.21. | \\(n\\) | \\(R_C(n)\\) | . | 3 | 1/10 | . | 4 | 1/10 | . Table 5.6: Number of rings in the simple networks represented in figure 5.21. | \\(n\\) | \\(R_C(n)\\) | . | 3 | 0/10 | . | 4 | 2/10 | . In the most simple cases, such as the one represented in figure 5.21, the networks can be distinguished using only the number of rings [Tab. 5.5]. Nevertheless in most of the cases other information are needed to describe accurately the connectivity of the networks. Description of the connectivity: difference between rings and nodes . The second information needed to investigate the properties of a network using rings is the evaluation of the connectivity between rings. Indeed the distribution of the ring sizes gives a first information on the connectivity, nevertheless it can not be exactly evaluated unless one studies how the rings are connected. The impact of the relations between rings, already presented in figure 5.20, has been illustrated in detail in figure 5.22. Figure 5.22 represents the different possibilities to combine 2 rings with 6 nodes and 1 ring with 4 nodes in a network composed of 16 nodes. Figure 5.22: The 9 different networks with 16 nodes, composed of 2 rings with 6 nodes and 1 ring with 4 nodes. Among the 9 networks presented in figure 5.22 none can be distinguished using the \\(R_C\\) value [Tab. 5.7]. Table 5.7: Number of rings for the different networks presented in figure 5.22. | \\(n\\) | \\(R_C(n)\\) | . | 4 | 1/16 | . | 6 | 2/16 | . Furthermore it is not possible to distinguish these networks using the \\(R_N\\) value. Table 5.8: Number of rings per node for the networks presented in figure 5.22. | Case a) | | \\(R_N(n)\\) | . | | \\(n\\) | | King / Guttman. | | Primitive / Strong. | . | | 4 | | 4/16 | | 4/16 | . | | 6 | | 10/16 | | 12/16 | . | | | | | | . | Cases b) \\(\\to\\) i) | | \\(R_N(n)\\) | . | | \\(n\\) | | All criteria. | . | | 4 | | 4/16 | . | | 6 | | 12/16 | . It seems possible to isolate the case a) [Tab. 5.8] from the other cases b) \\(\\to\\) i) [Tab. 5.8]. Nevertheless the results obtained using the primitive rings criterion are similar for all cases a) \\(\\to\\) i) [Tab. 5.8], this is in contradiction with the second statement [[Pr2]] proposed in our method. Before introducing parameters able to distinguish the configurations presented in figure 5.22 it is important to wonder about the number of cases to distinguish. From the point of view of the connectivity of the rings, configurations a), b), c) and d) are clearly different. Nevertheless following the same approach configurations e) and f) on the one hand and configurations g), h) and i) on the other hand are identical. A schematic representation [Fig. 5.23] is sufficient to illustrate the similarity of the relations between these networks. The difference between each of these networks does not appear in the connectivity of the rings but in the connectivity of the particles. Figure 5.23: Schematic representation of cases g) \\(\\to\\) i) (1) and e) \\(\\to\\) f) (2) illustrated in figure 5.22. Thus among the networks illustrated in figure 5.22 six dispositions of the rings have to be distinguished (a, b, c, d, e, g). The proportions of particles involved, or not involved, in the construction of rings will become an important question. The new tool defined in our method is able to describe accurately the information still missing on the connectivity. It is a square symmetric matrix of size \\((R-r+1)\\times (R-r+1)\\), where \\(R\\) and \\(r\\) represent respectively the bigger and the smaller size of a ring found when analyzing the network: we have called this matrix the connectivity matrix [Tab. 5.9]. Table 5.9: General connectivity matrix. | C\\(_{mat}\\) = \\(\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} P_N(r) &amp; P_N(r+1,r) &amp; \\cdots &amp; P_N(R,r) \\\\ P_N(r,r+1) &amp; \\ddots &amp; &amp; P_N(R,r+1) \\\\ \\vdots &amp; &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ P_N(r,R) &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\cdots &amp; P_N(R) \\end{array} \\right]\\) | . The diagonal elements \\(P_N(i)\\) of this matrix represent the Proportion of Nodes at the origin of at least one ring of size \\(i\\). And the non-diagonal elements \\(P_N(i,j)\\) represent the Proportion of Nodes at the origin of ring(s) of size \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). The matrix elements have a value ranging between 0 and 1. The lowest and non equal to 0 is of the form \\(\\frac{1}{Nn}\\), the highest and non equal to 1 is of the form \\(\\frac{Nn-1}{Nn}\\), where \\(Nn\\) represents the number of nodes in the network.

The connectivity matrix of the configurations illustrated in figure 5.22 are presented in table 5.12. We see that this matrix allows to distinguish each network whatever the way used to define a ring is. This matrix remains simple for small systems (crystalline or amorphous) or when using a small maximum ring size for the analysis. Nevertheless its reading can be considerably altered when analysing amorphous systems with a high maximum ring size for the analysis. To simplify the reading and the interpretation of the data contained in this matrix for more complex systems, we chose a similar approach to extract information on the connectivity between the rings. As a first step we decided to evaluate only the diagonal elements \\(P_N(n)\\) of the general connectivity matrix. Indeed these values allow us to obtain a better view of the connectivity than the standard \\(R_N\\) value. Table 5.14: \\(P_N(n)\\) - Proportion of nodes at the origin of at least one ring of size \\(n\\) for the networks in figure 5.22. | | | \\(P_N(n)\\) | . | | \\(n\\) | King / Guttman. | Primitive / Strong. | . | Case a) | | | . | | 4 | 4/16 | 4/16 | . | | 6 | 5/16 | 7/16 | . Table 5.14: \\(P_N(n)\\) - Proportion of nodes at the origin of at least one ring of size \\(n\\) for the networks in figure 5.22. | | | \\(P_N(n)\\) | . | | \\(n\\) | All criteria. | . | Case b) \\(\\to\\) c) | | . | | 4 | 4/16 | . | | 6 | 12/16 | . | Case d) | | . | | 4 | 4/16 | . | | 6 | 11/16 | . | Case e) \\(\\to\\) f) | | . | | 4 | 4/16 | . | | 6 | 12/16 | . | Case g) \\(\\to\\) i) | | . | | 4 | 4/16 | . | | 6 | 11/16 | . It is clear [Tab. 5.14] that using \\(P_N(n)\\) improves the separation between the networks illustrated in figure 5.22. Nevertheless \\(P_N(n)\\) does not allow to distinguish each of them. We notice that the distinction between networks is improved [Tab. 5.14] in particular when compared to the one obtain with \\(R_N(n)\\) [Tab. 5.8]. Therefore in a second step we chose to calculate two properties whose definitions are very similar to the one of \\(P_N(n)\\). The first, named \\(P_{N_{\\text{max}}}(n)\\), represents the proportion of nodes for which the rings with \\(n\\) nodes are the longest closed paths found using these nodes to initiate the search. The second named, \\(P_{N_{\\text{min}}}(n)\\), represents the proportion of nodes for which the rings with \\(n\\) nodes are the shortest closed paths found using these nodes to initiate the search. The terms longest and shortest path must be considered carefully to avoid any confusion with the terms used in section 5.5.2 to define the rings. For one node it is possible to find several rings whose properties correspond to the definitions proposed previously (King’s, Guttman’s, primitive or strong ring criterion). These rings are solutions found when looking for rings using this particular node to initiate the analysis. In order to calculate \\(P_{N_{\\text{max}}}(n)\\) and \\(P_{N_{\\text{min}}}(n)\\) the longest and the shortest path have to be determined among these different solutions. \\(P_{N_{\\text{max}}}(n)\\) and \\(P_{N_{\\text{min}}}(n)\\) have values ranging between 0 and \\(P_N(n)\\). The lowest and non equal to 0 is of the form \\(\\frac{1}{Nn}\\), the highest and non equal to 1 is of the form \\(\\frac{Nn-1}{Nn}\\), where \\(Nn\\) represents the total number of nodes in the network. For the minimum ring size, \\(s_{min}\\), existing in the network or found during the search, \\(P_{N_{min}}(s_{min})=P_N(s_{min})\\). In the same way for the maximum ring size, \\(s_{max}\\), existing in the network or found during the search, \\(P_{N_{max}}(s_{max})=P_N(s_{max})\\). To clarify these information it is possible to normalize \\(P_{N_{\\text{max}}}(n)\\) and \\(P_{N_{\\text{min}}}(n)\\) by \\(P_N(n)\\). By reducing these values we obtain, for each size of rings, values independent of the total number of nodes \\(Nn\\) of the system. Then for a considered ring size the values only refer to the number of nodes where the search returns rings of this size: \\[P_{max}(n) = \\frac{P_{N_{max}}(n)}{P_N(n)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad P_{min}(n) = \\frac{P_{N_{min}}(n)}{P_N(n)} \\nonumber\\] The normalized terms \\(P_{\\text{max}}(n)\\) and \\(P_{\\text{min}}(n)\\) have values ranging between 0 and 1. The lowest and non equal to 0 is of the form \\(\\frac{1}{Nn}\\), the highest and non equal to 1 is of the form \\(\\frac{Nn-1}{Nn}\\). For the minimum ring size, \\(s_{min}\\), existing in the network or found during the search, \\(P_{min}(s_{min})=1\\). In the same way for the maximum ring size, \\(s_{max}\\), existing in the network or found during the search, \\(P_{max}(s_{max})=1\\). \\(P_{\\text{max}}(n)\\) and \\(P_{\\text{min}}(n)\\) give complementary information to the ones obtained with \\(R_C(n)\\) and \\(P_N(n)\\) in order to distinguish and compare networks using ring statistics. We can illustrate this result by presenting the complete information obtained with this method [Tab. 5.17] for the networks represented in figure 5.22.

If a ring of size \\(n\\) is found using a particular node to initiate the search, \\(P_{\\text{max}}(n)\\) gives the probability that this ring is the longest ring which can be found using this node to initiate the search. At the opposite, \\(P_{\\text{min}}(n)\\) gives the probability that this ring is the shortest ring which can be found using this node to initiate the search. Thereafter we will use the terms ’connectivity profile’ to designate the results of a ring statistics analysis. This profile is related to the definition of rings used in the search and is made of the 4 values defined in our method: \\(R_C(n)\\), \\(P_N(n)\\), \\(P_{\\text{max}}(n)\\) and \\(P_{\\text{min}}(n)\\). The atomes program provides access to the connectivity profile of the system under study and allows to choose the study the connectivity using all the different methods used to define a ring. Thus King’s rings, Guttman’s rings, Primitive rings as well as Strong rings analysis are available. | S. Le Roux and P. Jund, Comp. Mat. Sci., vol. 49, pp. 70–83, 2010. | S. Le Roux and P.

    "doc": "Bond defects in ring statistics",
    "title": "Bond defects in ring statistics",
    "content": "ABAB and BABA rings . The ring statistics of amorphous networks are often focused on finding rings made of a succession of atoms with an alternation of chemical species, called ABAB rings. The most common examples come from the alternation of Si and O atoms (in silica polymorphs) or Ge and S (in GeS\\(_2\\) polymorphs). These solids are usually built with tetrahedra (SiO\\(_4\\) or GeS\\(_4\\)) therefore we study the network distribution of tetrahedra. The ideal technique to setup the analysis of such systems is to choose the atoms of highest coordination to initiate the search, respectively Si in SiO\\(_2\\) and Ge in GeS\\(_2\\). In most cases all rings can be found using this method. Nevertheless we can demonstrate that some solutions, so some rings, can be ignored by this analysis. This is highlighted in figure 5.24 which represents a cluster of atoms isolated from an AB\\(_2\\) amorphous network. Figure 5.24: Cluster of atoms isolated from an AB\\(_2\\) amorphous network. A bond defect is located on an atom of the chemical species B (blue square). When looking for King’s shortest paths [S. 5.5.2.1] using the chemical species A to initiate the search the central ring with 10 nodes is ignored. However among the solutions of the analysis (with the initial nodes circled in green) other rings with 10 nodes are found in the network. We can see that this piece of network is characterized by a bond defect. An atom of the B species appears to be over-coordinated by three atoms of the A species. When looking for rings, using the King’s criterion [S. 5.5.2.1] and initiating the search using the A atoms, the central ring with 10 nodes is ignored. Nevertheless other rings with 10 nodes are found and stored as solutions of the analysis. In order to find the central ring the search has to be initiated from the overcoordinated B atom. By analogy with the terminology ABAB this ring can be called a BABA ring. Indeed the alternation of chemical species is well respected. Therefore it is legitimate to question the relevance of the analysis without this result. In other words we have to check out if this BABA ring is, or not, an ABAB ring. The properties of this ring meet the definition and can therefore improve the description of the connectivity of the network. This kind of coordination defect [Fig. 5.24] is uncommon in vitreous silica [1], [2], nevertheless it is frequent in chalcogenide glasses [3], [4]. Homopolar bonds . In amorphous materials the homopolar bond defects can have a significant influence on the ring statistics. This is true in particular for AB\\(_2\\) chalcogenide glasses. Figure 5.25 illustrates standard cases that may be encountered when looking for rings in an AB\\(_2\\) system which contains homopolar bonds. Figure 5.25: Illustration of the influence of homopolar bonds in ABAB rings: in both examples the smallest rings found when initiating the search using the circled nodes (green color) contain an homopolar bond A-A or B-B. The smallest rings found when initiating the search using the circled nodes (green color) are not ABAB rings. Therefore their size must be given using the total number of nodes. In figure 5.25 the smallest rings are a ring with 9 nodes and a ring with 11 nodes containing respectively an A-A and a B-B homopolar bond. These rings are significantly smaller than the shortest ABAB ring with 18 nodes that may be found when looking for rings using the same green-circled nodes to initiate the analysis [Fig. 5.25]. The atomes program provides options to take into account or avoid A-B-A-B rings as well as homopolar bonds. | J. P. Rino, I. Ebbsjö, R. K. Kalia, A. Nakano, and P. Vashishta, Phys. Rev.

    "content": "One of the first information it is possible to extract from ring statistics, except the number of rings, is the number of rings not found by the analysis. Indeed calculation times do strongly depend on the maximum search depth, ie. the maximum size of a ring. To carry out the analysis this value has to be chosen to get the best possible compromise between CPU time and quality of the description. Nevertheless whatever this limiting value is, some rings of a size bigger than the maximum search depth may not be found by the analysis. In the King 5.5.2.1 and the Guttman’s criteria 5.5.2.2 it is possible to evaluate the number of \"potentially not found\" rings or rings that \"potentially exist\". Thus for a given atom At we can consider that a closed path exists and is not found: . | If the atom At has at least 2 nearest neighbors . | If no closed path is found: . | Starting from one neighbor to go back on the considered atom At (Guttman’s criterion) . | Between one couple of neighbors of the atom At (King’s criterion) . | . | If the 2 nearest neighbors of the atom At have at least 2 nearest neighbors (to avoid non bridging atoms) . | . Thus if during the analysis these 3 conditions are full filled (1, 2-a, 3 for the Guttman’s criterion, and 1, 2-b, 3 for the King’s criterion) then we can say that this analysis has potentially missed a ring between the neighbors of atom At. The smaller this number of \"potentially\" missed rings will be the better this analysis will be and the better the description of the connectivity of the material studied will be. The term \"potentially\" has been chosen because the method only allows to avoid first neighbor non bridging atoms. ",

Many of the video codecs available in atoms [Fig. 5.19] are sensitive to the parameters that can be entered in this dialog. For instance the MPEG-4 and H264 video codecs seem to be very sensitive to the utilization of standard video resolutions (800x600, 1980x1024 ...). However by default atomes input the dimensions of the OpenGL window as Movie resolution and the codec might not like non-standard parameters as the values in figure 5.19, and the encoding could fail. Depending on the codec this might be true for any of the parameters that can be adjusted in this dialog. Moreover error messages (from the encoding library) are not necessarily displayed, and the error might not be seen directly. However even if the encoding fail atomes will not crash, and as long as the \"Cancel\" button of the dialog [Fig. 5.19] is not pressed all data required to encode the movie is perfectly safe in memory, and there is no problem in retrying to encode with a change of parameters.
